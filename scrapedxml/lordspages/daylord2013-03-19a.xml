	UK: Ageing Population
	 &mdash; 
	<i>Question</i>
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.485.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="485"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_0">
	<p pid="a.485.1/1" class="indent">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will publish their assessment of the implications of the ageing of the United Kingdom's population and their response to those implications; and, if so, when.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.485.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="485"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_1">
	<p pid="a.485.2/1">We welcome the committee's report on the ageing population that was published last week. We will consider its recommendations carefully and respond in due course. Effective reform of public services is critical if we are to meet the needs of an ageing population and ensure long-term sustainability. We have put in place an ambitious programme of reform across a wide range of government policy areas, including pensions, health, social care, housing and employment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.485.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="485"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_2">
	<p pid="a.485.3/1">I thank the Minister for his reply. As the House may know, the committee found that our society and Government were woefully underprepared for this major social change. To focus the supplementary question on health, out of courtesy to my colleague, the report found a massive increase in demand and cost driven by the increase in long-term conditions. In the committee's view, this posed perhaps the biggest challenge the NHS has ever had to face. Will the Secretary of State set out his assessment of these challenges and what he proposes to do about them?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.485.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="485"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_3">
	<p pid="a.485.4/1">My Lords, we know that to adapt and respond to future need, the health and care system needs to change. The conclusions of the noble Lord's report correlated in many ways with our own analysis in this respect. The challenges that the report sets out create an opportunity for the NHS and local authorities to innovate and explore new ways of working together to meet the needs of their local populations better and to optimise the use of resources, which is of course critical. We think the NHS and local authorities are best placed to understand the opportunities that exist in their areas, and we are committed to supporting them in that regard.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.485.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100863" speakername="Lord Mawhinney" colon=":" colnum="485"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_4">
	<p pid="a.485.5/1">My Lords, will my noble friend undertake to intercede with the usual channels so that your Lordships' House can have an early and full debate on the report from the Select Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change, given the highly significant consequences that would flow if the committee, of which I was a member, even got it half right?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.486.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="486"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_5">
	<p pid="a.486.0/1">My Lords, I can say to my noble friend that I will certainly do that, because this is a very important report. I thank not only the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, but all members of the committee, who worked extremely hard to prepare a very well thought out set of conclusions.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.486.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100258" speakername="Baroness Greengross" colon=":" colnum="486"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_6">
	<p pid="a.486.1/1">My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that social care has been the poor relation for so many years and that we need integration as soon as possible with health and housing? To achieve that, would he commit to the Government mandating integration and earmark sufficient funds so that this care can be a reality as soon as possible for older people with chronic conditions?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.486.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="486"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_7">
	<p pid="a.486.2/1">My Lords, I very much agree with the noble Baroness. It is our ambition that people should receive high-quality, integrated, person-centred services that deliver the best outcomes to the service user. Making the service as a whole more efficient is the other benefit of integrating service. There is no single definitive model of integration. Some localities are further advanced than others in thinking about new ways of delivering it. We are developing the concept of pioneers to support the rapid dissemination and uptake of lessons learnt across the country, but we want to encourage local experimentation as much as we can to allow local areas to provide integrated care at scale and pace.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.486.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101089" speakername="Baroness Jolly" colon=":" colnum="486"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_8">
	<p pid="a.486.3/1">My Lords, there are several common themes between the report from the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, and his group, and that of the scrutiny committee of the draft Care and Support Bill, which was published today. One of those themes is the funding of personal care, which has to be shared between the individual and the state. As recommended by the Dilnot commission, will the Government invest in an awareness campaign to inform people of this situation and the importance of planning ahead?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.486.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="486"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_9">
	<p pid="a.486.4/1">I am sure my noble friend is right that there is a job of work to do to inform people about the new arrangements that we are bringing in to implement the Dilnot recommendations. My right honourable friend the Chancellor's announcement at the weekend confirms that we will introduce a cap on care costs and extend the means test upper capital threshold at the earlier date than previously announced, namely on April 2016. The reason for the change in date is to bring it into line with changes to single-tier pensions. We will need to disseminate this information sooner than we would otherwise have done.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.486.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101111" speakername="Baroness Bakewell" colon=":" colnum="486"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_10">
	<p pid="a.486.5/1">My Lords, when I was appointed the voice of older people in 2009, these issues were already well appreciated. It is now 2013. This is an excellent report from the House committee, which everyone recognises, but I am afraid that it joins many other reports on my shelf that have been published since 2009. Will the noble Earl please tell me why he thinks change is so slow?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.487.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="487"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_11">
	<p pid="a.487.0/1">My Lords, change is an increasing imperative, at least in my judgment, at local level. I talk not only to professionals in the health service but to local authorities, which will very soon be charged with looking in the round at the needs of patients and service users in their area. They know that with the financial constraints that are upon us, services need to change in order to remain sustainable and affordable. That will be a very strong driver to ensure that some of these very good recommendations are driven forward at pace.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.487.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="487"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_12">
	<p pid="a.487.1/1">My Lords, the Opposition warmly welcome the report. I am sure that it will be influential in the way we develop policies in the future. I was interested in the noble Earl's response when he talked about public sector reform. Does he agree that the overwhelming message of the report is the need for a fully integrated health and social care system? Is he not as worried as I am that the changes in the NHS that he is introducing on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase> will in fact lead to a disintegrated system in which, instead of co-operation and integration, competition will become the name of the game?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.487.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="487"  time="014:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_13">
	<p pid="a.487.2/1">No, I do not agree with that. We have always said that competition is but one tool in the armoury of commissioners. It is not a panacea by any means. As for disaggregation, I see the opposite at local level. Health and social care, public health and patient organisations are getting together for the first time to break down silo barriers and the traditional divisions that have existed.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.4/1" class="indent">To ask Her Majesty's Government why the Department of Health removed from the NHS Choices website the advice that there was no good quality evidence to show that homeopathy was more successful than placebo.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.5/1">My Lords, NHS Choices consults the Department of Health as necessary to ensure the consistency of its information with government policy. A recent review of the homeopathy web pages led to a change in the way the evidence was presented. Following concerns that the changes were unclear, NHS Choices has further clarified this information.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.487.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100626" speakername="Lord Taverne" colon=":" colnum="487"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_16">
	<p pid="a.487.6/1">My Lords, I am delighted to hear that the passage has been restored. However, it is disturbing that inquiries made under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that officials deleted the passage as it stood in response to lobbying by a charity founded by the Prince of Wales. They seemed to be more concerned not to offend that formidable lobbyist than to listen to the advice of their Chief Medical Officer, who declared in a recent statement to a House of Commons Select Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.487.6/2">&quot;I am perpetually surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.6/3">I have only recently learnt that a BBC South West programme found that Prince Charles's favourite pharmacy has been selling sugar pills as vaccines against some serious diseases. I am sure that my noble friend, to whom I could not give notice of this point, will look into the matter. Will he assure the House that the policy of the Department of Health is to promote evidence-based medicine and not treatment based on nothing but water?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.488.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="488"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_17">
	<p pid="a.488.0/1">My Lords, I shall certainly look into the particular matter raised by my noble friend. The change in the way the information was presented on NHS Choices was as a result of a formal review, which happens automatically to all NHS Choices pages every 24 months. The page on homeopathy reached the formal 24-month review point in January 2011. The policy of NHS Choices is to provide objective and trustworthy information and guidance on all aspects of health and healthcare, and the page on homeopathy does exactly that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.488.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100669" speakername="Lord Walton of Detchant" colon=":" colnum="488"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_18">
	<p pid="a.488.1/1">My Lords, more than 10 years ago I chaired an inquiry conducted by your Lordships' Select Committee on Science and Technology into the field of complementary and alternative medicine. We examined the evidence in favour of homeopathy, accepting that certain well qualified doctors believed in its use. However, at the time we did not discover any convincing research evidence to suggest that it was better than placebos. Over the centuries, many medicines have been used that have been shown to be no better than placebos. Therefore, has the time not come when it is appropriate for the Government to recognise that, in the light of recent research, there is no evidence whatever to support the continued use of homeopathy in the NHS?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.488.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="488"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_19">
	<p pid="a.488.2/1">My Lords, we have been consistently clear that no treatments should be arbitrarily rationed on cost grounds. The NHS constitution sets out that patients have a right to expect local decisions on the funding of drugs and treatments to be made rationally following a proper consideration of the evidence. More importantly in this context, it is the responsibility of the NHS to make decisions about commissioning and funding of healthcare treatments and not for Ministers to second-guess that process.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.488.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100695" speakername="Lord Winston" colon=":" colnum="488"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_20">
	<p pid="a.488.3/1">My Lords, perhaps I may be permitted to help the Minister. Many years ago, there was a very interesting study in Wales of a placebo-controlled trial that showed that, whatever was given, the best chance of a treatment working, placebo or not, was whether the doctor who was giving the medicine actually believed in it. Does the same apply for homeopathy and the Secretary of State?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.489.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="489"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_21">
	<p pid="a.489.0/1">My Lords, the best way I can answer the noble Lord is to refer him to the page on NHS Choices that explicitly refers to the placebo effect. As he will know, the 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos. It is important to emphasise that message. On the other hand, many people have found benefit from homeopathic medicines and, in a way, that is their privilege and right.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.489.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100229" speakername="Baroness Gardner of Parkes" colon=":" colnum="489"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_22">
	<p pid="a.489.1/1">My Lords, is the Minister aware that homeopathy started at a time when the one treatment they gave people was to bleed them? It was effective because they did not bleed them and allowed them to recover normally; I was on the board of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital for a good many years, where I learnt that. Does the Minister not think that, faced with a situation where antibiotics have been used too casually, it is time to look at what we should not be taking? Does he think it important that patients should have the right to whatever treatment they choose provided that homeopathy does not allow them to escape proper diagnosis for cancer or some other tragic condition, which could be overlooked if it is not combined with ordinary medicine?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.489.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="489"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_23">
	<p pid="a.489.2/1">My noble friend makes an important point. We are clear in recommending that patients should talk to their GPs before stopping any treatment that has been prescribed by a doctor in favour of homeopathy and before they start taking homeopathic remedies. It is important that people understand that homeopathy may not be effective in many situations.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.489.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100870" speakername="Baroness Corston" colon=":" colnum="489"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_24">
	<p pid="a.489.3/1">My Lords, given that many GPs ask for training in homeopathy and become homeopaths using both conventional and homeopathic medicine, and speaking as someone who personally uses homeopathic remedies, will the Minister ensure that the views of people such as the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, with which we are all familiar, are not given such credence within the National Health Service that those who wish to use homeopathic remedies do not have that choice?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.489.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="489"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_25">
	<p pid="a.489.4/1">My Lords, I take the noble Baroness's point. Again, we have consistently said, in this and in other areas, that clinical responsibility for an individual's health condition rests with their GP, who must therefore be able to justify clinically any treatment to which he or she refers someone. As she said, there are GPs who have a speciality in homeopathy. We recommend that a patient who is interested in homeopathic treatment should go to such a GP.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.1/1">There has been continued and significant growth in Chinese visitors coming to the UK, demonstrating that we support growth through the visa system. In 2012, UKBA processed almost 300,000 visa applications from Chinese nationals, and the number of visas issued to Chinese nationals increased by 7% in the year to December 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.2/1">The reality is that between 2004 and 2011, while the United States saw a growth in Chinese visitors of over 400%, we managed just over 50%. Overall, the United Kingdom's share of Chinese tourism has declined by one-third during the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/2">Turning to non-tourism activities, is the Minister aware that, for example in our superyacht-building sector, the chief executive of the British Marine Federation said recently:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/3">&quot;Chinese tourist restrictions are a straitjacket on the UK marine industry which is harming businesses, sapping the economy, and costing local jobs&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.3/1">Well my Lords, my noble friend is quite right to exhort us to greater effort, but he should be well aware of the work that is being done through our network of BritAgents throughout China and indeed our partnership with British Airways, which is opening a new route from Chengdu to London this year. This partnership and the way in which we are building our relationship with Chinese visitors are proving successful. Indeed, the most recent International Passenger Survey data revealed a 24% increase in the number of Chinese visitors in 2012 compared with 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.4/1">My Lords, is the Minister aware that the most recent World Economic Forum analysis of tourism competitiveness showed that Britain's visa regime has gone from 22nd to 46th? Not only that, we are 139th out of 140 for the charges at our airports and on tickets because of our old friend air passenger duty. Last week, we had the debacle around Brazilian visas added to the current difficulties with Chinese visas. There are people out there desperate to come to Britain. They spent &#163;18.7 billion in Britain last year, 4% more than the year before. Why are we making it so difficult for them?</p>

Is the Minister not aware that there is a lot of resentment and disappointment with this country because of the difficulty with visas? It is also affecting inward investment to this country. Is he aware of that? It is affecting the number of students who are coming here. Students are going to Australia and America instead. This thing is real, as the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, has said. Will something be done about it?</p>

	<p pid="a.491.1/1">We are trying to make the visa application process as customer-friendly as we can. The form itself is available in Chinese so that applicants can complete it in Chinese and online. We are dealing with a real issue. Either we have visa controls or we do not. I am sure that this House would not suggest to Her Majesty's Government that we drop visa controls. Indeed, we review visa controls, but for China we require them. The most important thing is that we have a system in place that reflects the interests of this country in protecting its borders and the interests of those who want to come here. They will be welcome for business, tourism and indeed for study.</p>

	<p pid="a.491.4/1">My Lords, I am disappointed that the Minister sounds extraordinarily complacent on this issue. He has heard from all sides of the House that there is a serious problem, and it is not the case that people are saying there should be no visas. It seems that we are making matters extraordinarily difficult for people from China and, as we have heard, from Brazil who would contribute to the economy of this country. Does the Home Office or any other part of government undertake an economic assessment of the impact these visa regulations are having?</p>

	<p pid="a.491.5/1">My Lords, there are no visas for Brazil, and there is no plan to introduce them. That decision was made last week, and an announcement was made to that effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.5/2">I am not complacent about this issue. I see the enormous potential of tourism and commercial links with China. I think it is a very important area of activity. However, as I explained in my answers to noble Lords, we need to maintain a visa system for our own border security. Having decided that we need to put one into place, and I am very pleased to hear that the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, agrees with that decision, the task is to try to make sure that the processing is as straightforward and easy as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.5/3">I have given illustrations of the figures. We should talk in figures and not in speculation. I have given the figures that 97% of visa applications are processed within 15 days and that our charge of &#163;81 compares with the &#163;126 it costs a UK citizen for a visa to go to China. We try to keep our service as competitive as possible, and it is right to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.492.2/1">My Lords, the Bank of England Act 1998 already gives powers of operational responsibility for monetary policy to the independent Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. The Act requires the Treasury to specify the objectives of the MPC at least once every 12 months. The Chancellor set the remit for the MPC at Budget 2012 to target inflation of 2%, as measured by the 12-month increase in the consumer prices index.</p>

	<p pid="a.492.3/1">My Lords, there have been widespread reports that the Chancellor was looking at that remit with the possibility of changing it. I appreciate that it may have been only a Lib Dem Budget leak but is it true and, if so, what does he propose to do about that kind of leak? Does the Chancellor, as has been said, believe in a looser monetary policy, and has he told the new Bank governor that that is what he wants him to do?</p>

	<p pid="a.492.7/1">My Lords, bearing in mind that Section 19 of the Bank of England Act 1998 gives reserve powers to the Treasury to give directions to the Bank of England, am I right that those powers have never been used? I am pretty sure that I am right. Does it not follow that the failure-despite the fact that the Act says that this is the MPC's objective-to hit the inflation target for three years without the slightest sign that it will be hit for the next two years, coupled with monetary easing, is down to the MPC?</p>

	<p pid="a.493.0/1">My Lords, inflation has been higher than the 2% target for a number of years. The MPC has taken the view that the target would be met in the medium term and that, because the principal reasons for inflation did not include excessive domestic demand and are therefore less capable of being moderated by increases in our own interest rates, it was wiser to &quot;see through&quot; the temporary increase in inflation above 2% but to work, as the MPC has, on the basis that, in the medium term, inflation would indeed come down to 2%.</p>

	<p pid="a.493.3/1">My Lords, from what the noble Lord has said, the Treasury has clearly been content with the policy pursued by the Monetary Policy Committee over the past three years. Is the noble Lord also content with the impact of that policy on pensioners' annuities?</p>

	<p pid="a.493.4/1">My Lords, the Government's view is that it is in the long-term interests of everybody, including pensioners and families, that we deal with the deficit and get growth going on a sustainable basis. In the short term, the Bank has taken the view that to keep within the inflation target and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the Government, including their objectives for growth and employment, it should keep interest rates low.</p>

	<p pid="a.493.5/1">My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that many people increasingly feel that the brief give to the American Fed, which is rather wider than the brief given to our Monetary Policy Committee, would be advantageous? Instead of looking solely at inflation, it would enable the Monetary Policy Committee to examine the effect of high interest rates on the rate of exchange. The pound has been kept higher than its purchasing power parity for years and, as a result, we have a huge trading deficit. A trading nation really ought to look seriously at its rate of exchange, which ought to be one of the factors that a new remit should cover.</p>

	<p pid="a.494.1/1">My Lords, has the Minister noticed that the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England has floated the idea that banks should be entitled to charge negative interest on savings? Even the new Governor of the Bank of England, when he was in Canada, was apparently within days of allowing such a policy. This would be immensely damaging to savers. Will he put this to rest, immediately and unequivocally, and say that there is no possibility of the Government sanctioning any such idea?</p>

	<p pid="a.494.2/1">My Lords, an awful lot of ideas have been floated recently but the key remit for the Bank of England is set by the Chancellor. Within that, the Bank has operational independence on how it follows that remit.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.494.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="494"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_57">
	<p pid="a.494.7/1">My Lords, I will also speak to Amendments 5, 7 and 10 in this group. These amendments stand in my name and in those of my noble friend Lady Sherlock, the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester. I say at the start that we view the amendments as consequential on Amendment 1, and we are advised that should these amendments be carried, they do not pre-empt a discussion on the subsequent amendments on the Marshalled List.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/2">Amendments 1 and 7 would remove the reference to 1% in Clauses 1 and 2, and hence would remove the 1% cap on the uprating of the relevant sums and amounts. Amendments 5 and 10 would delete the prohibition on uprating such sums and amounts under the annual uprating of benefits and tax credits. As we explained in Committee, we fully intend these amendments to negate the fundamental purpose of this Bill, which is to lock in real-terms cuts to a range of benefits for the two years to March 2016. This follows on from the equivalent cut for next year, which has been implemented by Statutory Instrument.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/3">The uprating of benefits and tax credits should proceed in accordance with the existing statutory framework, whereby the Secretary of State is required each year to review the rates of various benefits and tax credit components to see whether they have retained their value in relation to the general level of prices. There is no general requirement to fully uprate, but there is an obligation to assess on the basis of up to date information on the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/4">On these grounds alone, the Bill is completely unnecessary. If the Government are intent on three years of cuts by 1% uprated, they can use existing mechanisms, just as they have for 2013-14. They would then at least retain some flexibility to revisit the policy, especially if inflation were to surge above currently expected levels. If the Bill stands, there is no certainty about the level of real cuts that have been imposed on some of the most vulnerable people in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/5">The government assertion that committing these cuts to primary legislation is crucial to giving confidence to the markets has no credibility. It is frankly untenable to suggest that by locking into legislation these estimated benefit savings, which amount to less than 0.1% of government spending, the markets will be assured and comforted. It does not seem to have cut any ice with the rating agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/6">Let me reiterate Labour's position. We will make no commitment now on spending or tax for the next Parliament, and we will set out our spending plans at the time of the next election. However, right now, we would uprate in line with inflation. I will come in a moment to how the Government can plug the hole in their increasingly fragile finances.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/7">This Bill is misdirected on several other counts. We are told by the Secretary of State that cutting benefits and tax credits is necessary in advance of universal credit, as a contribution to fiscal consolidation. However, it does nothing for the deficit or borrowing. Indeed, by withdrawing real resources from low-income families, which of necessity have the highest marginal consumption rates, it is damaging demand. It ignores the IMF warning that the fiscal stabilisers should be allowed to operate. Just last week, the <I>FT</I> joined an increasing chorus of those pointing out that fiscal tightening could raise the debt ratio in the short term, as fiscal gains are partly wiped out by the decline in output.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/8">We also had the spectacle of the Prime Minister being rebuked by the OBR for asserting that the Government's debt-reduction programme had not affected growth. Its justification is supposed to be that there needs to be some correction for the fact that benefits have been uprated at a faster rate than earnings over the past five years: essentially, that those out of work have done better than those in work. It is perverse, therefore, that some two-thirds of those hurt by the 1% restriction are those who are actually in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/9">Looking at percentages rather than cash amounts is misleading. One per cent of a small number is a very small number. Indeed, specifically included among the cuts are in-work support such as working tax credits, SSP, SPL and maternity pay, as well as in and out of work benefits such as housing benefit: the very support that enables individuals to sustain employment and manage work and family responsibilities. We are told that the Government are committed to eradicating child poverty, and of course we would accept that child poverty is not only about income levels, but improving income and relative income is an essential component of tackling poverty, and matters are being made worse by this Bill, with another 200,000 children being drawn into poverty. Compared with CPI uprating, this Bill and the 2013-14 order mean that 30% of all families are affected, losing on average &#163;156 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/10">Worst of all, at a time when this Bill is reducing the living standards of the very poorest, the Government are rewarding those with the highest income, including some 8,000 millionaires, with a generous tax cut. The contrast could not be greater: a &#163;2,000 a week tax cut for some; a 71p a week rise if you claim JSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/11">By leaving inflation risk with claimants, this Bill is creating greater risk for the poor and uncertainty about their real incomes. The 2012 Autumn Statement cited energy and fuel prices as a source of potential risk over the coming year. It estimated that inflation would be higher in 2013 and 2014 than originally announced due to rises in domestic energy prices and food commodity prices: the very costs that hit the poorest hardest. Sterling has fallen some 8.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, pushing up import prices. All these matters will now affect the incomes of the poorest, and they are things that they have no way of influencing. They are being cut further adrift from the mainstream of society.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/12">Uncertainty is compounded by there still being no cumulative impact assessment for the raft of benefit and tax credit changes that have been introduced so far by this Government, including council support changes and the bedroom tax, which are about to become a horrible reality. The IFS has analysed the effect of the 2013-14 tax and benefit changes in its 2013 <I>Green Budget</I>, concluding that the,</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/13">&quot;broad pattern of tax giveaways and welfare takeaways means that the changes, on average, reduce net incomes towards the bottom of the income distribution and increase net incomes in the middle and upper parts of the distribution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/14">It states that below-inflation uprating is the predominant cause of the losses in the bottom half of the income distribution and the reduction of the top rate of tax from 50% to 40% the main gain for the richest. So the rich need more to motivate them and the poor need less.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/15">Our opposition to this Bill is clear. We oppose it locking in indeterminate cuts to real incomes through to April 2016. We argue that the normal uprating process should operate and have been clear that, right now, we would support uprating by inflation. We will continue to argue for the reversal of the proposed tax handout to the very rich. We heard the Minister at Second Reading and in Committee suggest that the saving that such a reversal would produce would be illusory because the rich would order their affairs to make sure that the will of the Government was defeated. We would maintain that the Government do not have to acquiesce in this. If they believe in tackling tax avoidance, they could secure the revenues that reversing this tax cut should generate. We are told by the Secretary of State that other countries have cut benefits. Well, so has this country. We have had cuts to contributory ESA, cuts to DLA, cuts to housing benefit, cuts to council tax support, cuts to child tax credits, cuts to tax credits and now cuts in this Bill, yet we still have no growth and debt continues to rise.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.7/16">We are asked today to sign off this further three-year cut affecting the poorest, the ultimate real size of which we cannot be certain of-and this the day before a Budget that may well visit yet further cuts. I urge noble Lords to prevent this from happening.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.0/1">My Lords, I have put my name to this amendment and will briefly signify my support. There is not a lot that I can add to the comprehensive account given by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. The only point I would stress was made by somebody on television last night-that we now live in an environment where inflation is considerably higher than we were used to in the first decade of this century. We understand that the new Governor of the Bank of England advocates that the inflation target should be allowed to float free. We are in an environment where inflation is set to hover around 3.5% or higher with no prospect of it reducing. In these circumstances, to cap the increase in benefits at 1% is simply unjustifiable. I support the amendment moved so comprehensively by the noble Lord.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.497.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100219" speakername="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" colon=":" colnum="497"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_59">
	<p pid="a.497.1/1">My Lords, there is no one in this Chamber who would not like to see support for those on low incomes and families to be increased. What was striking when the noble Lord proposed this amendment was that, apart from a vague suggestion that it might be possible to find the money by pursuing tax evaders, there was no indication of where the &#163;3 billion needed to provide uprating in line with inflation-assuming the Government's forecasts are correct-could be found. That is deeply irresponsible and it is particularly irresponsible of an Opposition who will not say what they would do in government. In other words, while it is not their responsibility, their line is &quot;You should spend the money&quot;, but when it might be their responsibility, they are not prepared to say what they would do. That is completely dishonest politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/2">We have a dangerous position in our country, partly caused by the present Government constantly harping on about how they have reduced the deficit by a quarter. According to a poll carried out by ITN and a separate poll by the Centre for Policy Studies, which may not be quite so objective, when asked the question, &quot;Do you think by the end of this Parliament the national debt will have gone up by &#163;600 billion, be just the same, or will have gone down by &#163;600 billion?&quot; only 6% got the answer correct: that it will have gone up by &#163;600 billion. So here we are, living in a country where we have to make difficult decisions-this Bill is an example of having to make difficult decisions-and where the vast majority of people believe that the Government are cutting debt, when in fact all the Government are doing is reducing the amount by which the debt is increasing. I will wager that when we have a debate at the end of this Parliament and come the next election, the Opposition will pursue the same kind of irresponsible tactics which we see in this amendment. They will say, &quot;The Government were elected to reduce the debt, but the debt has gone up by 50%. If we had been in government, it would have been different&quot;. That is the politics of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/3">Let us look at it from the point of view of people on low incomes-working or non-working-faced with inflation. If we follow the prescriptions contained in this amendment, the consequence will be that the pound will sink still further. The consequence of the pound sinking still further is that the energy and fuel costs that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, spoke of will go up. So how does it help people who are struggling to say &quot;Your benefits will go up by inflation&quot; if at the same time you pursue policies which will result in higher inflation and higher debt and leave an even bigger problem to solve at the end of the day, which will be solved on the backs of the poor?</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/4">The noble Lord said that the Government are handing out a tax-free benefit to the very rich. I remind him that when his party were in Government, people on very high incomes were paying less in marginal rates of tax than they are now. I also remind him that the effect of cutting the top rate of tax from 50% to 45% will be, as has been proved over and over again in countries around the globe, that the revenue to the Treasury will go up. Although the noble Lord and his party quite rightly point to the excesses in the City arising from bonuses, and so on, they seem to forget that 52% of those obscene bonuses come back in tax and national insurance. Actually, it is more, because there is an employers' contribution of 12%, so 64% of those bonuses come back to the Treasury in revenues.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/5">The name of the game here is to increase revenues to the Treasury. Then we will be in a position to do something about welfare. We are now in this difficult position and my noble friend is having to take this painful legislation through the House. The Opposition should recognise that that is a consequence of their period in government. The noble Baroness shakes her head. While they were in government, welfare benefits went up by 60% in real terms.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.498.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100219" speakername="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" colon=":" colnum="498"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_61">
	<p pid="a.498.1/1">Yes, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, makes the point that a large percentage went to pensioners, but I do not hear from the opposition Front Bench a cry that we should cut the benefits to pensioners to avoid this position. The very fact that she says that from a sedentary position indicates that she accepts that.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.1/2">Whatever the merits of how the money was distributed, it went up by 60%. One pound in every &#163;4 which this Government are spending-by the way, that is money which we have not got because we are having to borrow &#163;150 billion every year to make that expenditure-is going to welfare. To argue that it is not necessary to constrain welfare expenditure in those circumstances is, frankly, totally irresponsible. It is the worst kind of politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.1/3">The noble Lord seeks to present people on this side of the House as uncaring and unconcerned about the poor whereas, actually, if you are concerned about people who are hard up, you want to make sure that the costs of living for them and the stoppages in their pay packet are reduced to as low a level as possible. If we follow those prescriptions of continuing to spend money we have not got, of continuing to pay more in welfare than people are gaining in increased incomes in the private sector, that is the road to Carey Street and to undermining our whole welfare system of support.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.1/4">The truth is that while Labour was in office, it was paying tax credits to people on up to &#163;50,000 a year. It was a policy deliberately designed to create a client state, and it was a policy funded on the back of a bubble created by holding down interest rates. It was irresponsible economics and it was irresponsible public expenditure. A responsible Government, faced with the windfall tax revenues that they had, would have put some aside for a rainy day. Now we find ourselves with a huge, exploded welfare budget and difficult decisions that need to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.1/5">I hope that the House will reject the amendment which, while we all appreciate the sentiment, would actually do down those who are hardest up in our society and having the most difficulty. The noble Baroness shakes her head. It is the consequence of spending money which we did not have.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.499.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100275" speakername="Lord Harris of Haringey" colon=":" colnum="499"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_62">
	<p pid="a.499.0/1">My Lords, I hesitate to give the noble Lord a lesson in economics, but the problem that the Government currently face is a complete absence of growth. Further cuts in welfare benefits will make that worse. One thing that you can say for certain is that the people on the lowest incomes will spend that money and that that money will then feed into the economy, therefore doing something about the growth problem that the Government have exacerbated by what they have done in the past few years.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.499.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100219" speakername="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" colon=":" colnum="499"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_63">
	<p pid="a.499.1/1">I do not think that was a lesson in economics but a lesson in magic. If that is the case, why do we not just double welfare benefits? People will spend even more, the economy will grow and everything will be fine. The noble Lord nods his head in agreement. As an individual or as a household, you cannot continue to spend more than you earn without getting into the kind of problems that we have seen among people who have taken out payday loans.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/2">This is the payday loan approach to government. You have a big debt, so you take out another one. You pay a higher rate of interest on it but you hope that somehow you will be able to pay it back. In the end you are able to pay only the interest. At the moment the Government are printing money to fund their expenditure requirements. That is quantitative easing. In 1997 the Bank of England held no government bonds. Now it holds 27% of the entire bonds in issue. When interest rates rise, those bonds will fall in value. How will the difference in value be made up? That will be a cost for the taxpayer. Our level of borrowing now, which will have gone up by 50% by the end of this Parliament, will have to be financed and that will come out of the future welfare budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.1/3">The noble Lord is describing a way of robbing our children of their living standards and creating a bigger problem for the next generation to meet the needs of those who are most vulnerable. This is a way of making it more expensive to create the safety net that we all support. This is not a lesson in economics but in the kind of fantasy approach to politics that got us into this position in the first place. That is why the Government are right to persevere with this legislation. Indeed, they have been very reasonable in their approach. They have tried to protect the most vulnerable and have agreed to increase welfare payments by 1%. This is extraordinary, given that we have an economy that is not growing at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.500.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100219" speakername="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" colon=":" colnum="500"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_65">
	<p pid="a.500.1/1">The noble Lord seems to think that the reason why the economy is not growing is that the state is not large enough. How big does he want to the state to be? It is already taking nearly 50% of everything created by the Government and spending it, and that is not enough because they have to borrow on top of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.1/2">If levels of taxation are high, which they are, and levels of regulation are high, we will not get the growth that is required. We need to constrain public expenditure to make room for the private sector to create wealth. Once we have a bigger cake, everyone can have a bigger slice, but if we try to proceed in this way we will end up with a smaller cake and those dependent on welfare benefits will be cruelly cheated. They will find their living standards destroyed by inflation, higher costs and the inability of the Government to finance the kind of programmes that Members opposite are prepared to say now that they would support, although they are not prepared to say so at a general election.</p>

	<p pid="a.500.2/1">My Lords, I agree with a particular point that my noble friend has made and would like to add that the Bill has come forward on an especially interesting day. I refer to Cyprus. The warning is on the packet. There has been a certain amount of calm around, as though we had come through all our problems and were moving steadily forward into calm waters, and as though the eurozone was secure. The financial markets, with the euro increasing in value, may have had that illusion. However, it has all been blown away. I have not heard any recent news; I do not know whether there has been a decision yet about what Cyprus will do. We should remember that, at the moment, there is a very real risk. Clearly, people have been caught in Cyprus. If Portugal, Spain and Italy decide that this will be the European practice, people there may find that their savings and funds in their banks are not as secure as they had been assured they were. After all, everyone thought that there was a clear undertaking that below a certain level, around &#8364;100,000, their own bank accounts were at no risk. If that changes, we face a very serious situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/2">There is complacency around, as I picked up from an article today by the chief economist of HSBC, as though with just a bit of going forward and a bit more luck we will be back on the old growth train and in the business that we were in before. What has been exposed is that over many years we have been living on borrowed money, on a construction boom in the financial services area and on public expenditure. Now that those have to be constrained, suddenly people are turning around and saying, &quot;How, as a country, are we going to earn our living in future?&quot;. We are finding that we have slipped in the leagues. In one of our most successful areas of overseas earnings, defence expenditure, we have now slipped a place and China has overtaken us. China is now taking away a number of the markets that our manufacturers used to serve extremely well. It is said that we hope to sell Typhoon to Oman, the UAE and one or two other countries, but the point has been made that its successor will be made in America, and that will be the end of one of our most successful overseas earnings. When you see where we earn our living in the world, we are not in a happy place.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/3">That is why I very much agree with my noble friend Lord Forsyth. All of us in this House would like to say, &quot;Let's increase benefits. Let's deal with all the hard cases and see how we can give people more money&quot;. Look at the situation in Ireland, where benefits have been cut by, I think, 10%. There has been talk of cuts today but in fact we are taking about how big an increase the Government should impose, not an absolute cut in the amount. Other countries in Europe are cutting by 6%, 10% or 12% the actual amount that people are getting-what hardship that must represent.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/4">This is not a pleasant speech to make. It is much more popular to say, &quot;Let's have some more benefit&quot;. I say this against a background of a new situation that has suddenly come upon us: if this House-the unelected House of Lords-decides today to cut right through one of the decisions made as part of the prudent financial planning to find our way out of the problems that we are in, and if that triggers a loss of credibility in our national approach and the Government's approach to tackling those serious problems, it will really be a problem for people on benefits if there is a run and we then find that the low interest rates that the Government have enjoyed for their substantial borrowing no longer apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/5">I agree with my noble friend on this point. There is an illusion that somehow we are reducing our debt. We are not; we are reducing the rate at which the debt is increasing. One of the blessings that we have had is that at least we have been able to borrow at an extremely low rate because we had some credibility. If the House of Lords today kicks away one of the planks that help to shore up the credibility of a Government who have a plan to try to deal with our problems, and if those international interest rates are then demanded of the Government and the country when we try to borrow money, the problems that we will incur for all our people could be vastly greater. Look at the tragedies that exist now, such as the unemployment rates in Spain, which is 50% in certain age groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/6">We have held things together so that we have a lower unemployment rate than the eurozone countries. There is so much that we have to hang on to. This is a dangerous time. I say seriously to your Lordships: do not tamper at this stage with this very difficult situation, at a time when we are least able to face it and when it could quite seriously endanger our whole economic structure. I do not think that people understand what a mess the world is in at present. There is a huge amount of complacency around. We are not by any means out of the woods yet, and it is our duty to ensure that we hold firm.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.2/7">I intend to support my right honourable friend Iain Duncan Smith, whose commitment to this area I think we all admire enormously. He is doing the best that he can. He is agreeing to an increase in benefits for the most deserving people in this country, but not as large an increase as they might have hoped to see. That is the only realistic approach that can be taken at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.502.0/1">My Lords, I have lent my name in support of this amendment, and I am happy to speak in support of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/2">This debate is about who should bear the greatest weight of the burden imposed by the Government's need to reduce debt. I hope that the noble Lords, Lord King and Lord Forsyth, might consider accepting an invitation from me to come to the city of Leicester to explain to our local Child Poverty Commission why it is in the interests of children in poverty that they should become poorer at the moment because that will serve the national interest regarding debt, and that this House is working in their interests by reducing the uprating of their income to 1%, however much inflation rises. They might accept an invitation to explain that also to the unemployed and to voluntary associations in Leicester, which anticipate a tsunami of difficulties such as homelessness and dependence on food banks. They can come to listen to the response to this Bill from those who are dependent on benefits through no choice of their own, who can explain what that is like and how much harder it will get in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/3">If the purpose of this Bill is to control welfare costs, this is not the right way to go about it. The key to reducing the benefit bill is to change the circumstances that lead many people to need benefits, such as the absence of job opportunities, too much short-term, low-paid work, the shortage of affordable housing, and expensive, patchy childcare. We should be focusing on those issues, not cutting benefits in real terms, which simply creates hardship without addressing the underlying issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/4">This Bill is both unnecessary and ill conceived. It will harm the most vulnerable in our society and do nothing to promote work incentives. I have heard nothing at Second Reading, in Committee or today to make me change my view that this Bill ideologically shrinks the welfare state regardless of desperate need. Nor does it change my view that we are heading for a US-style welfare system that is dependent on food banks and hostels. We know that we can do better than this, we must do better than this, and we should amend the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.503.0/1">My Lords, I do not think that anyone could claim that I was other than at the wet end of the Conservative Party. I am perfectly prepared to say that. However, I have to speak after the right reverend Prelate because he has expressed exactly what the problem with Britain is: we are to spend money that we do not have on people who are in need, at a rate we cannot afford. That is not at all a Christian comment. In the end, we have to live within our means. For those of us who were brought up in the difficulties of a poorly paid Anglican parsonage, the first lesson that we learnt was to spend within our means.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.0/2">I disagree with my noble friend Lord Forsyth, who said that the previous Government were not responsible. They are responsible, because they spent the money that was there and which could now be available for what we need. We were put in this position by the party opposite because they had the best inheritance of any Government, but they spent it and borrowed on top of it. I cannot find a single speech from any right reverend Prelate from that time that warns the Government of the dangers of spending money that they did not have, borrowed in a way that could not be repaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.0/3">I believe in an old sermon of my father's, which distinguished between love and sentiment because &quot;love&quot; is a very tough word. It does not pretend there is an easy way out of the problems with which we are faced. Love says that we have to do this in a way that safeguards the future and does not merely deal with the present problem. People sometimes talk as if those of us on this side of the House do not know the problems with which we are faced. Many of us have worked for years, trying to deal with those problems and being concerned about the poor. We have found, though, that you have to be honest. The reason we have to cut in this way-not cut, but cut the addition that might otherwise have been paid-is simply because we live in a country that has spent more than it has earned for so long that it can no longer go on doing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.0/4">I have to say to the right reverend Prelate, who did not provide an answer, that the answer is not to make things worse. All the things he is asking for are being done at the same time. Those are precisely the Government's policies for getting the economy moving. I beg him not to pretend to people that there is another means of dealing with these matters. If we do what he proposes, in two, three or four years' time we will not be talking about decreases in increases but about the very cuts in welfare benefits that are happening in the rest of Europe. We are talking as though we are nothing to do with the rest of Europe. Some of my colleagues on this side of the House sometimes talk about that far too much. We are in exactly the same position, except that we have so far weathered this storm better because we have a Government who have behaved more sensibly right from the beginning. I beg the right reverend Prelate not to pretend to the world that there is a simple answer. The only answer is this tough one and I am amazed that it has not had to be tougher. Nobody can go on living on debt. I leave the House with the comment made by my noble friend: this proposal from the right reverend Prelate and the party opposite is a payday loan approach, and that is what is so serious about it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.504.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101024" speakername="Lord German" colon=":" colnum="504"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_69">
	<p pid="a.504.0/1">My Lords, in his speech moving the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, made it perfectly clear that it would break the Government's policy proposal. There was no indication given of how much the benefit bill should rise, though the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, indicated his preference. However, that is not what is in front of the House. If the amendment were to be passed there would be no proposal as to how much it should rise: 0.5%, 1.5%, 2%, 3% or whatever. Neither does the amendment offer any solutions: it does not offer any ameliorations, it does not seek any exemptions. However, Her Majesty's Opposition say no to a 1% cap on working-age benefits, yet support a 1% cap on public sector workers' pay. It is quite strange. I sometimes wonder whether we are living in a parallel universe where the economy is healthy, where there have not been any fundamental economic shocks and where Cypriots can get all their money out of their banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/2">However, it is not like that and the Bill is not set in the sort of financial vacuum that some Members seem to think it is. I accept that borrowing is higher than it ought to be, though I wish it were less. I know that we have had to borrow in order to maintain the essence of our welfare state and I agree that growth is critical. However, in these tough times the Government have to take difficult decisions. These decisions are, no doubt, uncomfortable but it could have been worse. As I said at Second Reading, there were lots of things on the table for discussion which could have made this a much tougher prospect for us. As it stands, this is our biggest budget-the budget where we spend &#163;1 in every &#163;4 of government money-and, despite all previous efforts, it is still growing as a proportion of total government spend. Therefore, no matter what we may think, this budget has to make its contribution to helping to put our finances back on a sound footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/3">Yesterday, there was a debate in the Moses Room in which the Government proposed a &#163;2.545 billion reduction in the overall welfare spend for 2013-14. Her Majesty's Opposition rejected this as &quot;vicious&quot; and &quot;contemptible&quot;. Today, we have before us in this Bill a budget proposal of &#163;3.7 billion for the two years following, and that is also rejected by Her Majesty's Opposition. Therefore, &#163;6.245 billion of savings have been rejected in two days. Yesterday-I have not heard it yet today-I heard a vague assertion about tax avoidance, but it is my understanding that this Government are spending far more on tax avoidance than the previous Government did and putting far more effort into it. When she replies, perhaps the Minister can tell us how much success the Government have had compared with the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/4">However, we are talking about &#163;6.245 billion of savings and, in return, the Opposition are offering a tax rise. I refer to the issue of the 50% or 45% rate, which at Second Reading the Minister stated the OBR said would raise &#163;100 million. If you slice that &#163;100 million per annum off the total in cuts which have been rejected over the past two days, that means that there is still &#163;6 billion to find, just to round up the figures. Therefore, we should reject these amendments because they offer no solutions beyond borrowing even more, raising taxes significantly or making deep cuts elsewhere in government expenditure, putting the burden of raising the money to repay it on my children and grandchildren.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/5">This Bill would, in the end, save more than &#163;3 billion a year. In their final year, the previous Government were spending &#163;4 for every &#163;3 they raised from the people of this country in tax. In comparison, this Bill saves &#163;3 billion, but that should be compared with the last year of the Labour Government, when they were borrowing &#163;3 billion a week. This is not a comfortable position in which we find ourselves and I would prefer it not to be happening. I share the aspiration for growth and I want to see our country back on track again. However, as the International Monetary Fund said in its <I>World Economic Outlook</I> last October, Governments need to create the right conditions for growth. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/6">&quot;To anchor market expectations, policymakers need to specify adequately detailed medium-term plans for lowering debt ratios, which must be backed by binding legislation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/7">That is what the Bill proposes today and that is what the amendment just does not do. As we cannot get an answer to whether higher taxes, lower spending or borrowing alternatives-or a combination of the three-is being proposed, I have no hesitation whatever in recommending to my noble friends on the Liberal Democrat Benches that these amendments, should the Opposition put them to a vote, should be rejected.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.505.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100976" speakername="Lord Bates" colon=":" colnum="505"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_70">
	<p pid="a.505.0/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord German, referred to the Opposition's support for the cap on salary increases at 1%. I rise because I came across an interview that the shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, gave when that policy was announced. This policy will impact on people with a salary above &#163;21,000, below the benefit cap. When pressed on the &quot;Today&quot; programme about how he could justify limiting salary increases in the public sector to 1%, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/2">&quot;And if people expect the Labour Party to say 'We'll just oppose', we can't do that. [It] would be irresponsible because the priority has got to be getting people into jobs rather than people being paid more&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/3">That is quite an interesting statement for the shadow Chancellor to make because, in my view, it very much reflects the purpose of this Bill and this amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/4">I do not think that my noble friends on the Front Bench have made life easy for themselves by making this a stand-alone Bill. It certainly should not be viewed that way. It needs to be viewed in the context of the introduction of universal credit, which will bring about benefits of &#163;168 a month to 3 million families. That, because of the wage incentives and the attractiveness of work, will lead to an estimated 300,000 more people finding their way into employment. We need to be very clear that, in all of these measures, whether it be raising tax thresholds, universal credit or this Bill today, we are saying that the best route out of poverty is undoubtedly work.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/5">The scale of the challenge we have in doing that is quite immense. Prior to the recession, unemployment in this country was around 1.62 million. It rose very sharply and when the party opposite left office the rate was 2.49 million. It continued on a trajectory up to 2.68 million. However, it has started to fall and has been coming down quite steadily for a few months and is now down to 2.5 million. The figures show that there are 1 million extra private sector jobs, and that is to be welcomed. Benefit changes that encourage growth and help people find their way into employment are surely things we ought to support.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/6">It would also be nice to ask some of those who supported this amendment where they were last year when benefits were increased by 5.2% and salaries for the lowest paid went up by 1.7%. Where were their voices then? What is so compassionate about paying child benefit to people earning more than &#163;50,000 or letting people earning up to &#163;70,000 receive tax credits? We need to change the configuration so it is always in the interests of people to work and then we need to work to ensure that the jobs are there.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.0/7">How do we create the jobs for that to happen? Clearly we need to get public spending under control so we can raise tax thresholds for individual workers and also reduce corporation tax thresholds. We know that that creates employment the world over. That is why unemployment in this country is falling while in so many other countries it is rising. I understand the points that have been made quite seriously and the concerns that have been raised, but they are looking at this in isolation and, placed in context, this is undoubtedly a measure that in the years to come will reduce the levels of poverty in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.506.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101091" speakername="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" colon=":" colnum="506"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_71">
	<p pid="a.506.0/1">My Lords, there have been some very powerful speeches in this debate. I am very grateful to all my noble friends for their contributions and for laying out so clearly and eloquently the economic case for this Bill and for what we seek to achieve. As they have been so clear, I will not repeat much of what they have said. However, I will start by making clear to your Lordships' House that the amendments before us would, in simple terms, remove the commitment to a 1% uprating from the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, said in Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/2">&quot;We fully intend these amendments to undermine and negate the purpose of the Bill&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2013-02-25.855"><I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/13; col. 855</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/3">My noble friend Lord Newby said in reply that these are the sort of amendments that equate to,</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/4" class="indent">&quot;a vote against the Bill at Second Reading&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2013-02-25.866"><I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/13; col. 866</phrase>.].</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/5">It is important that we understand what these amendments seek to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/6">As has been made clear by my noble friends, these are not decisions that we take lightly. I do not deny that they will have impacts on those who receive the benefits in question or that those impacts will not be easy. However, we have made a conscious decision to protect those benefits which reflect the additional costs that disabled people face, while also protecting pensioners through our commitment to the triple lock.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/7">The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester is right to highlight those in need and I am glad that he does. It is important that we all remember and are conscious of the people affected by some of these changes. However, I ask him and all noble Lords not to forget that, as part of the Government's wider reforms, we are prioritising resources towards measures and reforms that support families and help to change lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/8">Let me name just a few of those measures. We are expanding early-years education to ensure that children have access to early education and to support parents in work. We are attaching additional funding to disadvantaged pupils through the pupil premium, which will rise to &#163;2.5 billion a year by 2014-15. We have protected the schools and NHS budgets to ensure that these vital services continue to support families. More than &#163;1 billion of investment will go into schools. We are introducing universal credit-a new, radically simpler benefit payment designed to ensure that work pays.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/9">As my noble friend Lord Bates already has acknowledged, this last change is about transforming our welfare system. It will significantly increase the incentive that people have to work. Indeed, we estimate that it will lead to up to 300,000 more people moving into work. It is important that we focus on that point for a moment. As my noble friends have already indicated in their speeches, we must not look at the changes that we are discussing today in isolation; we must see them in the wider context of the changes that the Government are making. They reflect the fact that this Government's focus is on how to help people off benefits and into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/10">We need to be aware of the level of support that people can receive while they are on out-of-work benefits. For many, this is supposed to be a temporary state-an interruption between periods of work. By making the system simpler, by reducing the risks from people moving into work and by making work pay, we can reinforce that temporary nature and ensure that more and more people are moving into work. That is what we are seeking to achieve through universal credit and, as I have said, I ask noble Lords to bear these wider changes in mind when considering this Bill and all the amendments that we will debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/11">This Bill is a short-term change, made at a desperately difficult time, as we seek to rebalance the public finances. However, in our other reforms we have made a huge commitment to the long term, a commitment to changing lives through helping people back to work. Although we still have challenges in the labour market, the fact is that more people are moving into work already. Unemployment is falling. Private sector employment is up by more than 1 million since the election and the number of people employed is at its highest level ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/12">We are continuing to provide for a 1% increase in these benefit rates. As my noble friends have said, this will mean that the value falls in real terms, which is not a decision that we take lightly, but it is an increase and we must compare this, as some of my noble friends already have, with what is happening elsewhere. Ireland has cut unemployment benefit by 4% a year for two years since 2010. Portugal has cut unemployment benefit by 6%. Spain has cut payments to people who are unemployed for more than six months by 10%. Let me remind noble Lords that the UK's deficit in 2010 was larger-I repeat, larger-than the latter two countries. I am not saying that that justifies the measures we are discussing today; they are justified by the need to rebalance the public finances. However, it is, I hope, a reminder that these are very difficult times. The actions this Government have taken and continue to take to reduce the deficit are helping to secure economic recovery, but there are still tough decisions to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/13">While this group of amendments seeks in simple terms to remove the 1% figure from the Bill, as many of my noble friends have already pointed out, it does not suggest an alternative. It should be noted that if the amendments before us were to pass, they would make it possible for the Government to increase benefits by any amount that they wanted in the years in question, without reference to prices or any specified factors, including uprating by less than 1%. Let us assume that the intention would be to upgrade in line with CPI. That would mean that the &#163;3 billion in savings from the Bill would not be delivered. I appreciate that the decisions we have made in the Bill are not easy. We never claimed that they were. However, they are absolutely necessary. This was made clear by my noble friends, who made contributions that were much more powerful than I could have made.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/14">Let us not forget that the central purpose of the Bill is to set out clear plans on uprating that deliver significant and vital savings that will help us on the road to economic recovery, along which we simply must travel if we are to preserve for the future the kinds of things that we value and from which we will all benefit: a stable economy, a growing labour market and opportunities for the next generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/15">When the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, moved the amendment, he said that all the amendments in the group were linked and were consequential one on another. Perhaps it is premature for me to make this point, but I will make it clear that in the Government's view the amendments are not consequential one on another. If Amendment 1 is agreed, the Government will not oppose Amendment 5. However, we will oppose Amendment 7. It is important to make that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.0/16">I have made the case for seeing these changes in a wider context, and my noble friends have made powerful contributions about the wider economic context. It is clear that the changes, while painful, are necessary. Therefore I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.508.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="508"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_72">
	<p pid="a.508.0/1">My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Low, for his support for the amendments in this group. He made the very important point that we are potentially moving into a period of greater inflation. This point was made last week by the <I>FT</I>, which talked about the risks of stagflation in this country. I also thank the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester for his support. He posed the key question: how will making these people poorer help the national interest? What we heard from noble Lords who oppose the amendment did not help us on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/2">I say to the Minister and to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, who prayed in aid universal credit, that it would be good to know that universal credit is on track because from everything we hear it is not. Even with universal credit as proposed, we know that something like 1.8 million people will have their benefits from work reduced in comparison to their current position.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/3">I stress that the amendment challenges the locking-in over a three-year period of the restrictions on uprating. Uprating by less than the rate of inflation is a real-terms cut. We should recognise that it is a cut in people's benefits. The fundamental proposition in the amendment is that these things should be looked at in the normal way on an annual basis by reference to what is happening to prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord King, and the Minister said that other countries are cutting benefits. Benefits have been cut in this country, too. Council tax benefit, housing benefit, DLA, ESA and tax credits have been cut by something like &#163;18 billion to date.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.509.0/1">Will the noble Lord confirm that no benefits in this country have been cut in cash terms, as they have widely been in the rest of Europe?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.509.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="509"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_74">
	<p pid="a.509.1/1">Housing benefit is one such benefit. Council tax benefit has been dumped on local authorities with a 10% restriction on funding, which means that people's support will be cut in cash terms. That is absolutely happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.1/2">I say to the noble Lords, Lord King and Lord Forsyth, that it seemed that the mention of Cyprus was meant to lead us to a conclusion that bears no relation to reality. We are not dealing with a situation here that would take us anywhere close to the situation in Cyprus. We are talking about restrictions on uprating which, on the Government's own figures, would amount to something like &#163;1.9 billion.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.509.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100348" speakername="Lord King of Bridgwater" colon=":" colnum="509"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_75">
	<p pid="a.509.2/1">The Government's ability even to pay this level of benefit will partly depend on our ability to borrow enough money at low enough rates to continue the policy. Is the noble Lord not aware that there is a big shiver going through the eurozone about the financial situation? It has suddenly come back into the headlines. If it was thought at this moment that the Government were going to deviate from their previously planned approach-if it was voted down by your Lordships' House-it would have a serious effect. Then the problems faced by some young people and people in poverty at the present time, as spoken to by the right reverend Prelate, could be seriously aggravated. Our job is to try to make the best we can of a very difficult situation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.509.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="509"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_76">
	<p pid="a.509.3/1">My Lords, of course we are aware of what is going on in Europe, and I shall come on to issues of borrowing in a moment. We are talking here about an amount that is less than 0.1% of total government expenditure. The noble Lord cannot seriously be arguing that taking our position rather than that of the Government would bring the whole edifice crashing down. That simply does not reflect reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.3/2">The problem that the Government have is that because they have failed to deliver growth in the economy there is a real risk-this is what is happening-that their austerity programme is making debt worse. This was again a point made in a very powerful article last week in the <I>FT</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.3/3">We have heard a great deal about the Labour Government's record. When the Labour Government left office the economy was growing again and it was the austerity measures which choked off that growth. As to the Labour Government's record on debt, before the international crisis hit, our debt levels were the second lowest in the G7, lower than when we came into office in 1997, I believe.</p>

	<p pid="a.510.0/1">I am following the noble Lord's argument very carefully. If he is saying that we can get growth again by spending money uprating benefits in line with inflation, why will he not therefore make the commitment that a Labour Government would do that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.510.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="510"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_78">
	<p pid="a.510.1/1">My Lords, I make the commitment that we should review on the usual basis at each uprating period. No Government or Opposition immediately prior to a general election are going to pre-empt the programme they would have. The noble Lord knows that full well. He is making a silly political point.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/2">There is a real risk that by cutting back you make the debt situation worse. It depends upon the multiplier. There have been some recent studies which suggest that it is made worse because the multiplier effect would mean that if you did not cut back you could create growth greater than the saving you are seeking to make. We shall hear from the Chancellor tomorrow about his view on borrowing for capital spend, for example. The relative merits of that depend upon the multiplier effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/3">Ultimately, the argument in favour of the Government's Bill as it stands is that it is locking in an unknown. You cannot know in year two or indeed the next year what the rate of inflation will be and you cannot know, therefore, the extent of the cut you are visiting on the poorest people in our country. That is what we object to in this Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.514.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100938" speakername="The Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds" colon=":" colnum="514"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_80">
	<p pid="a.514.1/1">My Lords, I will also speak to the other amendments in this group. Amendments 2 and 8 are paving amendments for a new clause to protect child benefits and child tax credits from the effects of this Bill. The substantive amendment to which they refer is Amendment 11. This follows extensive discussion in Committee, and is designed to halt the disproportionately negative effects of the Bill on children and their welfare. Amendments 13, 14 and 15 are consequential, and no doubt the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, will speak to her Amendment 14A.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/2">The Bill affects 30% of all households. Of those with dependent children, it affects 87%. Of lone-parent households, it affects 95%. Conspicuously, 11.5 million children suffer as a result of this Bill. This is in addition to the effects that our austerity measures have already had on children. In 2012, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that there would indeed be a reduction of 0.9% in real-terms income for all households from 2010 to 2016. For a couple with two children, that fall will already, without this Bill, be 4.2%: equivalent to a fall of &#163;215 per year for a couple without children, or &#163;1,250 for a couple with two children. This Bill adds to that discrepancy, and it is that which cannot be fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/3">It is true that we need particular concern for those in or on the verge of poverty. This Bill fails that test, too. For the poorest 20% of households, the IFS estimates to which I have referred suggest that the reduction in income is 7% from 2010 to 2016. In addition, 60% of the Bill's savings come from those in the poorest third of our population, and 3% from those in the richest third. This will mean that, on the Government's estimates, 200,000 more children will be in poverty, half of them in working families.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/4">That in itself must make us pause to see what other ways there are to make the &#163;0.9 billion savings which the child-related parts of this Bill are designed to produce in 2015-16. It is not for us today to declare what those alternatives should be. However, they do exist. Whether through reducing tax reliefs on pension contributions for the wealthy, or through introducing national insurance contributions on employer pension contributions, there are a number of different ways in which we could explore raising this money, which would not affect children in the ways in which this Bill does. We need to find a way for the burden of our fiscal challenges, so well described in the previous debate, to fall on those who, like me and many Members of this House, can afford to meet it, rather on than those who cannot. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, spoke in Committee of the importance of reviving the economy for the benefit of the future. That is absolutely right, but not at the expense of children's needs now.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/5">The major thrust of these amendments is to defend the nine out of 10 children in this country who are affected by the Bill. This effect is cumulative; it comes on top of the reductions already made. It has been argued that since many people are currently seeing wage increases of only 1%, benefits should also rise by only 1%. However, this Bill is an additional blow for those with children whose wages have increased by only 1%. Not only are their wages declining but, by this Bill, provision for their children will decline, too. These benefits affect those in work just as much as those who are not in work. None of the benefits referred to in these amendments is out an out of work benefit. This is a transfer of the burden from all of us to those with children, and that increased burden on children cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/6">I continue to be particularly concerned at the continued gradual erosion of child benefit. The 1% cap comes after three years of the freezing of child benefit, so it is a cap on a figure that has already been reduced. From 2011 to 2015, the increase in child benefit will be 2%, rather than the estimated 16% of CPI over that period. Therefore, a couple with three children with one earner, such as a corporal in the Army, will lose &#163;552 a year by 2015. A couple-one a childminder, let us say, earning &#163;240 a week and the other a postal worker on &#163;395 a week-with two children will lose &#163;351 a week by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/7">Child benefit has long been a crucial part of the support for families in our culture. That is particularly so for those on low wages. For very many families, child benefit is explicitly set aside to provide for children. Parents will struggle by making savings on their own lifestyle, sometimes even by going without meals themselves, but they will ensure that the child benefit that they receive is spent on their children. We owe it to the next generation to ensure that this element of our society, our children, is not disadvantaged, and certainly not disadvantaged by so much more than households without children.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/8">In addition, child benefit plays a particular role in support of those in work because it acts as an earnings disregard in the calculation of housing and council tax benefits. Any reduction in child benefit is therefore a disincentive to returning to work. For a two-child family in work, on a low income and living in rented accommodation, the cut between 2010 and 2015 is not only the &#163;4.80 a week in child benefit but an extra &#163;4.10 in lost benefits. This working family on a low income therefore loses almost &#163;9 a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.1/9">I need to refer briefly to the third element in this package, that of the lower disability addition of universal credit. That is already being reduced from its current &#163;57 a week to &#163;28 a week under universal credit. Now it will be reduced further by this Bill. It seems extraordinary to reduce a benefit before it has even come into effect, especially when it provides for the needs of disabled children and their extra financial demands. These children need our support so they can live full and creative lives, and therefore benefit not just themselves but all of us. Children already contribute more than their fair share to our austerity burden. This Bill adds to their burden. I hope that we shall at least remove this extra pressure on them by accepting this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.516.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101031" speakername="Baroness Sherlock" colon=":" colnum="516"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_81">
	<p pid="a.516.0/1">My Lords, I thank the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds for introducing this amendment. I also congratulate him on continuing to press his concerns in this area after failing to receive any comfort at earlier stages of the Bill. I congratulate the Lords spiritual in general for being willing to stand up for what they believe, despite the inevitable volley of artillery that came their way the moment they dared to raise their heads above the cathedral parapet. It may be that we have them to thank for the extended interest in welfare benefits, which is much more than we see normally. I am delighted to see it.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/2">As we have heard, this amendment would remove a number of children's benefits and credits from the scope of the Bill. Since we on these Benches wish to remove all benefits and tax credits from the scope of the Bill, we are pleased to support it. We have heard at different points in the passage of this Bill that it has a disproportionate impact on families and children. The Government's impact assessment shows that two-thirds of households affected are families with children. We also know that the Bill will have a direct effect on child poverty in Britain. Ministers have previously announced-as the right reverend Prelate noted-that this Bill alone will put a further 200,000 children into relative poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/3">In Committee, I asked the Minister to tell the Committee what the impact would be on the three other poverty measures in the Child Poverty Act. I got nothing back at all. Now the Child Poverty Action Group has dragged some information from the Government by means of the Freedom of Information Act-although it should not have had to use a FOI request to get it. I would have hoped the Minister could have told us the information when I asked for it in Committee. The Government have not yet offered a narrative assessment even of measures, for example, of material deprivation. However, they were forced to admit what would happen to the number of children in absolute poverty. In response to that FOI request, the DWP admitted for the first time that it estimates that around 200,000 more children in Britain will be pushed into absolute poverty by this uprating policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/4">This is a shocking figure, which reveals the depth of what is wrong with this policy. It also removes the Government's defence that the problem is with the relative poverty measure, rather than with the impact on children themselves. On the back of those figures, some new analysis for the Child Poverty Action Group by Landman Economics found that an increase of 600,000 children in absolute poverty is likely between 2010 and 2015, and that is net of any improvements as a result of universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/5">As we have heard at many stages of this Bill, too many parents go without to ensure that they can heat their homes and feed and clothe their children. As the costs of food and energy have soared, more parents spend more of their money on these basic costs. Yet vital support that they depend upon is being cut in real terms in order to hand a tax cut to the very richest. It is not only the Church of England that has come out against these priorities; Archbishop Peter Smith, vice-president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/6">&quot;It is unjustifiable that the poorest children, who often have no other safety net, will be left bearing the brunt of economic difficulties as a result of significant real-term cuts to social security&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/7">The archbishop noted something that many of us know: that like many other charities across the country, Catholic agencies supporting parents find themselves ever more confronted with parents unable to afford even basic essentials, such as healthy meals or warm clothes for their children. That would be exacerbated by this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/8">The real shame is that so many of those families have no alternative way of reducing that problem. Most victims of this Bill are working families. The parents are already doing the right thing; they are out working. One of the real disappointments about the debates we have had is the failure to acknowledge that, far from this being something that penalises only people who are not working, it is in fact the very same people who have had below-inflation or no pay increases and who have struggled repeatedly to get out, get work and get hours, who are hit by these cuts to tax and benefit support.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.0/9">The Bill is a completely inappropriate way to address the uprating of essential state support for families. We already have perfectly good mechanisms to uprate annually in the light of inflation and prevailing economic conditions. These are poor choices for the Government to be making. The families who will be hit are not responsible for the failure of the Government to get the economy growing again. They are just doing their best to manage in difficult times, but the Government are planning to cut the value of the help that they get from the state to fund a tax cut for people earning &#163;1 million a year. We should not be doing this, and we on these Benches are pleased and proud to support the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.517.0/1">My Lords, this amendment is simply a variation on the previous amendment. In the previous debate, we went through the arguments for why it is economically impossible to sustain inflation-related increases. I do not propose to repeat the arguments, but this amendment would result in exactly the same position, given that the exceptions proposed by the right reverend Prelate constitute a large part of the Bill. It is just a way of saying that, if one was going to make the same savings, one would have to make bigger reductions in the increases for everyone else, or else one would have to find the money. Once again, the right reverend Prelate did not tell us where the money would come from.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.518.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100219" speakername="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" colon=":" colnum="518"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_84">
	<p pid="a.518.1/1">I am happy to give way to him if he wants to explain where the money would come from, but I suspect not. A large part of his flock of the clergy will be recipients of benefits because of the wages that they are paid by the Church of England. Everyone is in the same boat here. The noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, argues that somehow it is possible to find money which we have not got and that she is proud to support the amendment because of the reduction in the top rate of tax paid by those who she describes as millionaires. I remind her that those people are paying 5% more in tax than they did under her Government. I also remind her that the effect of cutting those high rates of tax has been to increase revenue and therefore to make it possible to do more in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.518.1/2">Surely, by now, we have learnt that lesson. It is a cheap political argument to say that it is possible to create money out of thin air and that this Government want to protect the rich at the expense of the poor. If we want to help the poor, we have to get the economy growing again. The noble Baroness says that the economy is not growing because of this Government. The economy is not growing because of the burden of debt which she and her fellow members of the Labour Party ran up.</p>

	<p pid="a.518.2/1">The noble Lord keeps going on about debt. Is it not right that, because of the failures of the noble Lord's Government, the lack of growth has meant that borrowing is now about &#163;200 billion more than they planned when they came into being?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.518.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100219" speakername="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" colon=":" colnum="518"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_86">
	<p pid="a.518.3/1">I am utterly amazed by the noble Lord. He is now criticising us for spending &#163;200 billion more than we planned, when part of that money is being used to provide the 1% uplift in benefits. Talk about wanting to have it both ways. On the one hand, he is criticising the Government for not borrowing enough, but now he is criticising the Government for borrowing more than we planned. The reason why we are having to borrow more than we planned is because of all the commitments made by the previous Government without a clue as to how they would fund them. That includes commitments on welfare. Welfare spending accounts for &#163;1 in every &#163;4 that the Government spend.</p>
	<p pid="a.518.3/2">On the basis of the noble Lord's criticism that we are spending &#163;200 billion more, that would mean that &#163;50 billion is going on welfare. In all the time that I have been involved in both Houses of Parliament, I have never seen a more irresponsible Opposition. It is not good enough for the right reverend Prelate to come to tell us that we need to do more to help working families with young children without explaining from where the money is to come or addressing the main problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.518.4/1">My Lords, I have taken no part in this debate so far. Has the noble Lord not suggested somewhere where the money can come from; namely, that people like us could pay it? If children would benefit I am prepared to pay it. Is he and are we?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.519.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100219" speakername="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" colon=":" colnum="519"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_88">
	<p pid="a.519.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths of Burry Port. I did not think that he was a bishop and I was addressing my remarks to the Bishops' Bench, but I say to him that the burden of tax has gone up substantially, and the reductions in government expenditure have so far been quite limited. We are discussing not a cut in government expenditure but limiting the increase in government expenditure to 1%.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.0/2">I have had several goes at persuading the right reverend Prelate to indicate where the money for his proposal might come from. One possibility might be for people to put wages up. If the Church of England were to put up its clergy's wages, less would be claimed in benefits and more would be available for others, but that is not a practical proposition for the church because the church, like the Government, is faced with a financial crisis and has to live within its means. What is good for the church is good for the Government and is good for particular families.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.0/3">The most irresponsible part of the arguments that have come from the Bishops' Bench this afternoon is about what happens if inflation is allowed to let rip. I fear that that may be about to happen as we continue to print money and borrow. As the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, pointed out, we are borrowing far more than we planned to meet our commitments and to be fair to the most vulnerable. What happens when inflation takes off? I remember the 1970s, when inflation was running at very high levels, at 20% and more, and interest rates were at 15% and more. Who suffered? Children, the poorest and families suffered. There is nothing Governments can do to protect them once inflation takes off.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.0/4">We do not want to go back to that kind of society. It tried to cope with inflation by protecting people through indexation, but it was unable to keep up with it and the result was, as the then Labour Prime Minister put it so eloquently:</p>
	<p pid="a.519.0/5">&quot;Inflation is the father and mother of unemployment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.0/6">Jim Callaghan said:</p>
	<p pid="a.519.0/7">&quot;We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession, and now we know that you cannot&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.0/8">Those words were said as the Labour Government left in 1979, leaving another Tory Government to clean up the mess, just as we are doing now.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.0/9">The right reverend Prelate's amendment of course carries great emotional impact. We would all like to see working families with children have a higher standard of living, but the way to do that is to create the wealth that enables us to support those families and enables them to get the levels of income and employment that they need. You do not do it by shaving the edges of the currency, allowing inflation to take off and committing those families' children as adults to a debt burden that, frankly, will be impossible to pay off. They would be paying the interest for the rest of their lives, and that would disadvantage their children. In rejecting this amendment, as I hope she will, my noble friend is speaking not just for our children but for our grandchildren, who are entitled to expect responsible government in these straitened times.</p>

	<p pid="a.520.0/1">My Lords, I support what my noble friend Lord Forsyth said. When the right reverend Prelate comes to respond to the debate, I would be grateful if he would comment on the following point. He made great play, and I do not underestimate this, of the effect and impact of limiting the uprating of child benefit and child benefits generally to 1%. According to Appendix 3 of the helpful Library note on the Bill, regarding the child tax credit element, in 2011-12 the child element of child tax credit increased by 11.1%, a significant sum. That followed significant increases of 13% in 2008-09 and 12.5% in 2004-05. If one is to argue that limiting that increase now to 1% would have a significant effect, if you take it as a snapshot, that may be the case, but if one looks over time, one has to factor in those significantly higher-than-inflation increases that have occurred in the child tax credit element in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/2">One of the problems with trading figures with regard to child poverty is that you get some curious results. One of the most notable is that in 2010 there were 300,000 fewer people in poverty because the recession had caused the median income to drop-in other words, children were said to have been pulled out of poverty not because anything had changed in their lives but because the rest of society had got poorer. We have to be clear about what we are arguing for when we talk about the interests of children, which of course should be paramount.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/3">I turn again to a theme in the debate on the previous amendment: one cannot just take this in isolation. One needs to look at what the Prime Minister has announced today on childcare, for example, which will make a significant difference to people by enabling them to move into employment. One needs to look at the pupil premium or the raising of tax thresholds, which means that someone on the minimum wage has seen their tax bill halved under this Government. One has to look at these things in the round. Unlike the Opposition, we have ring-fenced the budget for the National Health Service, on which people significantly depend. Again, in the round, we need to get this absolutely correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/4">I will react to the charge that somehow there is an easy pot at the other end of the income scale to be tapped into. As a result of this Government's actions, the richest pay more tax on capital gains, more stamp duty on their homes and more tax on their pensions and are less able to evade tax than was the case before. These factors need to be borne in mind in the broad reach of these changes that I know when taken in cold, clinical isolation, one year at a time, without reference to trends over time, may allow one to draw one conclusion but should be placed in the proper context. I seem to recall from my youth the good theological concept of placing individual verses in context in order to understand their meaning, and one might think it was a good idea to place this one measure in the broader context in order to understand what the Government are doing to bring people out of child poverty, which we accept is significant. Other measures, such as limiting the proposed increases in fuel duty-another factor that has a big impact on the poorest in society, particularly those with families-and caps on rail fares and on council tax, all seek to address the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/5">We also need to recognise that child poverty has a wider set of causes than cash payment alone, and in many ways, we are focusing here on cash payment on its own. We need to place in context the fact that the children's opportunities and their likelihood of being in poverty are affected primarily by the extent to which they live in a workless household. Therefore, all our efforts to get people into work should be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.0/6">A child may live in a family with problem debt. One would therefore think that noble Lords would welcome the measures that we are seeking to take to reduce indebtedness and to encourage people to live within their means, with universal credit being paid on a monthly basis so that people get used to being responsible. A child may live in poor housing or in a troubled area, have an unstable family environment or attend a failing school. His parents may not have the skills to get out and get the job that they need, or they may be in poor health. These are a broad range of issues that ought to be reflected in our debates about child poverty. In that context, I believe that in time, primarily through encouraging more people into employment, we will see the child poverty targets in the Child Poverty Act, which this Government signed up to and agreed to, achieved by their set target date of 2020.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.521.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100453" speakername="Lord Newby" colon=":" colnum="521"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_90">
	<p pid="a.521.0/1">My Lords, the whole House can agree on one thing. We all want to support families with children and ensure that children in this country have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. We have been discussing how we attempt to achieve that in the extremely difficult economic times in which we live.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/2">I will spare noble Lords my speaking notes on the economic context, as we have already had a full debate on that. The only point I make in passing, in respect of the Opposition's policies on deficit reduction, is that they passed legislation saying that by the forthcoming financial year it would be illegal not to have halved the deficit. It is therefore particularly surprising that they seem to have had no plan at the time to do it and have given no indication since of how they might have done it.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/3">However, I must remind noble Lords again of the baseline from which these savings are being made. Tax credit expenditure increased by 340% under the previous Government compared to the benefits they replaced. Eligibility for tax credits was extended to nine out of 10 families with children and tax credits and child benefit accounted for &#163;42 billion this year, which is over 40% of working-age welfare expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/4">I will give noble Lords one other piece of context. The latest OECD figures show that of all the developed countries the UK, along with Ireland, spends the highest proportion of its national income on family benefits. We are not a country that takes these things lightly or a country that has not given very high priority to supporting families. We believe that that is absolutely a right priority and we support families with children as much as we can in the circumstances. Child benefit and tax credits exist to do that. However, as we have said, we have to focus resources where they are needed most.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/5">A number of noble Lords, including the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester and the noble Lord, Lord Bates, have mentioned that this Bill is only one of a large number of measures that the Government are taking which affect families with children, in particular poor families with children. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, referred to the pupil premium, which will cost the Government &#163;2.5 billion by next year. This will be worth &#163;900 per disadvantaged child-and that is &#163;900 in hard times. We are extending flexible support for early education. Since 2010, all three and four year-olds have been entitled to 15 hours of free childcare and we are extending this to 260,000 disadvantaged two year-olds from this year. This is immensely important to these families and it will be worth around &#163;2,900 a year for the poorest families who benefit-&#163;2,900 extra per family. We have found these hugely significant sums of money by making reductions elsewhere, because we place such a large priority on the poorest families.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/6">As the noble Lord, Lord Bates, said, we protected the schools budget and the NHS budget. We are spending &#163;1.2 billion on capital expenditure in schools. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, has said, one of the most important things we have to do is leave our children and grandchildren with a lack of deficit or a deficit that they can manage. The savings in the Bill attempt to begin to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/7">The first group of amendments would remove child benefit, child tax credit and the lower rate of disabled child addition in universal credit from the Bill. This would remove nearly half the savings from the Bill, which is around &#163;900 million in 2015-16. I should like to make a further point on universal credit, although it has not been the subject of much debate in this group of amendments. I am sure we will be dealing with this important issue in more detail when we debate Amendment 3, to which my noble friend Lady Stowell will respond. Suffice it to say that part of the principle underlying the decisions we have taken on disability and universal credit is the need for simplicity and our desire to target support to the most severely disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/8">The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds referred to child benefit and expressed his concern that it had been frozen or taken away from the highest earners. What he did not say was that the Government have increased child tax credit by &#163;180-more than inflation-to more than cover, in the first few years, the reduction in child benefit. Taking child benefit and child tax credit together, we have tilted the expenditure away from affluent families and put more of the cash into poorer ones. I think that is a sensible priority and I am surprised that he appears not to agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/9">A number of noble Lords have talked about the impact of the Bill on child poverty. As has been pointed out, the Bill is forecast to increase the number of children in absolute poverty by 200,000 and the number in relative poverty by 200,000. For the avoidance of doubt and in answer to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, my noble friend Lady Stowell wrote to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, copied to other noble Lords, on <phrase class="date" code="2013-03-13">13 March</phrase>. Her letter contained the figure about absolute poverty so, far from seeking to avoid mentioning it, we chose to circulate it. I am not saying that absolute poverty is not something we should be extremely concerned about but the term does not mean what most people think of as absolute poverty. The definition of absolute poverty is 60% of the median income in 2010-11 uprated to take account of inflation. The 200,000 children mentioned in respect of absolute poverty are very largely the same as the 200,000 who are mentioned in terms of relative poverty. You certainly cannot add those two numbers together.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/10">At previous stages of the Bill, we have discussed the definition of child poverty and the importance of tackling child poverty. We know that if we focus on the relative income line we get some very odd results. We have pointed out previously that in 2010 300,000 fewer children were said to have moved out of poverty, not because anything changed in their lives but because the rest of society got poorer. The estimate on the impact of this Bill does not take account of policies which would cause child poverty figures to move in the other direction, such as universal credit which is expected to lift up to 250,000 children out of poverty, depending on the effect of the minimum income floor. We take the issues of cash and poverty, as currently defined, very seriously, but we also think that we need a broader definition of child poverty. That is why the Government are currently consulting on a wider definition. As I set out two weeks ago, and repeat today, this Government remain committed to eradicating child poverty. We believe that income will remain an important part of any new measure on child poverty, but focusing our resources on benefits alone is not enough. We have to take action to tackle the root causes of poverty, some of which I have described today.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/11">I also take this opportunity to mention, as an example of what the Government are doing to support children and families in work with children, the announcement made today by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister concerning increasing eligibility for support to five times as many families as is currently the case through a new tax-free childcare scheme. Families where the parents are in work will be able to claim 20% of their childcare costs-equal to the basic rate of income tax-up to &#163;6,000. The scheme will be phased in from the autumn of 2015. More than 2.5 million hard-working families will be eligible to benefit from these new proposals, compared with existing schemes offered by fewer than 5% of employers. Families on tax credits will be eligible to receive support for 70% of their childcare costs, and we have already committed an additional &#163;200 million in universal credit, helping 100,000 more working families.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/12">Today's announcement of that further &#163;200 million of additional support in universal credit will provide working families with the equivalent of 85% of their childcare costs where the lone parent or both parents pay income tax. That additional support will improve incentives to work and ensure that it is worth while for low and middle-income parents to work up to full-time hours. It will be phased in from April 2016 when childcare support moves from tax credits to universal credit. Together, these proposals will help to ensure that working families are not held back by the costs of childcare. They will remove disincentives to work for many mothers and provide flexibility and support for businesses to generate employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.0/13">I hope I have been able to provide some reassurance that, although we are taking difficult decisions on welfare, they are necessary decisions. We are prioritising limited resources so that they go to measures that help families with children as well as those who aspire to work hard and get on. I therefore ask the right reverend Prelate to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.524.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100938" speakername="The Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds" colon=":" colnum="524"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_91">
	<p pid="a.524.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to all those who have taken part in this debate and, indeed, to the Minister for his extended response to the discussion. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, for her support and for the information that 200,000 children will be in absolute poverty as a result of the Bill. We have also recently had information from the Trussell Trust about the number of children who are now being fed through food banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/2">I thank the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, for his contribution, but this is not simply a variation on the previous amendment. For one thing, it would cost only half as much at &#163;0.9 billion, rather than the &#163;2 billion to &#163;3 billion which has been mentioned in relation to the whole Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/3">There have been a number of suggestions-not just from me but from a collection of other people-as to how this money could be raised. At an earlier stage in our discussions on the Bill, I made suggestions and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, responded that they were indeed possibilities but not ones that fitted in with the Government's current priorities. That is a perfectly fair response but it is not fair to say that taxing the winter fuel allowance or dealing differently with things such as free television licences, tax relief on pension contributions, national insurance contributions or employer pension costs and so on are not possible. They are possibilities. I was not quite sure what-</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.524.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100219" speakername="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" colon=":" colnum="524"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_92">
	<p pid="a.524.1/1">I am most grateful to the right reverend Prelate. My criticism was that he did not say which of these he wanted to do. If the church's position is that it wants to tax winter fuel benefits, please say so and say that the money from that could be used for this purpose. As for increasing taxes on pension contributions, he may not have noticed but the Government have already done that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.524.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100298" speakername="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" colon=":" colnum="524"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_93">
	<p pid="a.524.2/1">My Lords, I would have thought that the right reverend Prelate's point was that we are facing political choices, not ones of financial necessity. We can make choices here and we are choosing instead to go after poor children.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.524.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100938" speakername="The Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds" colon=":" colnum="524"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_94">
	<p pid="a.524.3/1">I thank the noble Lord and the noble Baroness for the answers they have given each other on this. It really is not my duty, as a Prelate in this House, to give the church's view on exactly how the money should be raised. It is a task to say that there are alternatives and, indeed, to make suggestions as to how the money might be raised. There is no policy on exactly how it should be and I do not think that it would be for me to try to produce the solution to what we are doing. There are alternatives. I do not believe that they should be placed on children.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.525.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101015" speakername="Lord Deben" colon=":" colnum="525"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_95">
	<p pid="a.525.0/1">I wonder whether the right reverend Prelate will understand this point. He is making specific remarks as to how we should spend the money. Is it not reasonable to say that he should take the responsibility for making specific suggestions as to how we should save the money?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.525.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100938" speakername="The Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds" colon=":" colnum="525"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_96">
	<p pid="a.525.1/1">My Lords, I have made a number of specific suggestions as to ways in which this money could be provided from elsewhere. My basic point continues to be that it should not be raised by putting the pressure on children and their families. I am grateful to the Government-and to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, for raising the matter-for the child tax credit increase of &#163;180 in 2011. It has to be said that that was, at the time, only the first of two announced upratings. The second, of &#163;110, never happened because of the economic state in which we find ourselves. That above-inflation increase in child tax credit did something to ameliorate the pressure put on those in most difficulty, particularly children, by various other provisions made over the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.525.1/2">I am grateful, too, for the announcements that the Minister has made this afternoon. However, one could say that if 20% of childcare is to be covered, that still means that those receiving that childcare need to find the other 80% in order to get the 20%. I absolutely agree with the Minister when he speaks of the need to tackle root causes and to make sure that more people are in work. I commend any efforts of any Government which lead in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.525.1/3">However, these amendments are about children and we have moved much more widely in our discussion of them. I am still stuck with the statistic that the decrease in income for a couple without children will be 0.9% over the five years, but for a couple with two children it will be 4.2%. It is the differential between those two figures that we need to tackle. I recognise that attempts have been made to tackle them but they have been stubbornly unsuccessful so far. In view of the various things that the Government do for children-I certainly accept that they have a concern for children-I am sorry that they cannot accept the amendment. In the light of that, I beg to test the opinion of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.529.1/1">My Lords, Amendment 3 would remove from the 1% uprating cap all aspects of the employment and support allowance, including the personal allowance component, the support group component for those in the support group and the work-related activity group component for those placed in the work-related activity group, which I may shorten to the WRAG as &quot;the work-related activity group&quot; is a bit of a mouthful and I do not wish to take up too much of your Lordships' time-no more time, at any rate, than I need to. Paragraph (b) of the amendment would also remove the child disability addition under universal credit from the cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/2">The Government have given the impression that disabled people are protected from the restriction of benefit increases to 1%, but this is not the case. Some disability benefits are protected-notably disability living allowance-but that does not mean that disabled people are protected from the restrictions introduced by the Bill as a whole. The only disabled people who are protected are those who receive no benefits other than the disability living allowance. The impact assessment makes clear that households where someone describes themselves as disabled are more likely to be affected than those where there is not a person who describes themselves as disabled: 34% of households as against 27%.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/3">Even some benefits specifically targeted at disabled people are not protected. This applies particularly to employment and support allowance. ESA is paid at two different levels according to whether claimants are placed in the support group, meaning that their impairment or condition is such that they are not expected to look for work, or the WRAG. Both groups receive a personal allowance of &#163;71 a week but those in the support group receive a support group component which is paid at a higher rate than the comparable component paid to those in the WRAG.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/4">The Government have given the impression that those in the support group are protected from the 1% uprating cap but, in truth, only their support group component of &#163;34 a week is protected: rather less than one-third of their benefit. This means overall that disabled people in the support group will see their ESA payments rise by only 1.4% rather than by inflation, not a lot better than if increases in the whole of their benefit were capped at 1%. As a result, a disabled person in the support group will be &#163;62.76 a year worse off. Capping increases in their benefit at 1% will mean that households receiving ESA in the work-related activity group will be &#163;87.65 a year worse off.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/5">However, it is worse than this. Although some disability benefits and some disability elements and components may be protected, disabled people may lose out overall because of the complex interaction of different benefits and components. Disabled people do not only receive disability benefits; they have children and rent houses, and so they are not immune from restrictions in the uprating of children's benefits, housing benefit and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/6">If a claimant in the support group does not have any other income, they are also likely to be entitled to housing benefit and council tax benefit. If they have children, they will also be entitled to child benefit and child tax credit. It can be seen that protecting the support group component protects only a small proportion of their overall benefit. For example, a lone parent who is in the support group and has two children will have lost &#163;18 a week or almost &#163;1,000 per year by 2015 compared with their position in 2011, simply due to uprating changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/7">The amendment is essential if the Government are to fulfil their pledge to protect disabled people from the 1% uprating cap. A third of disabled people in the UK were found to be living in poverty before the global economic crisis. Disabled people routinely experience higher living costs associated with their disability, on things such as equipment, personal assistance and special diets, for example. In Committee, the Minister said that ESA for those in the WRAG group is intended to be a short-term benefit:</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/8">&quot;Those who are placed in the work-related activity group are there because they have been found able to prepare for work&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2013-02-25.881"><I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/13; col. 881</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/9">However, that does not make sense in terms of work incentives. People's impairments often make it very difficult for them to work. Where this is not the case or the difficulties can be overcome, discriminatory attitudes in the workplace can present insurmountable barriers. In the current state of the economy, there just are not the jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/10">Finally, as we know, the work programme, by which the Government set such store, is just not working. In Committee, the Minister questioned the rationale for including the personal allowance in the amendment and for not subjecting it to the 1% cap. She said that treating the personal allowance differently from that in other parts of the benefit system would add an element of complexity and undermine the coherence of the system as a whole. That strikes me as a comparatively technical objection. If that is her principal concern, I ask her to look at the position again with me before Third Reading and see if we cannot find a way of achieving the purpose of the amendment without giving rise to the technical difficulties to which the Minister pointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/11">The second limb of the amendment would remove the 1% uprating cap from the lower child disability addition under universal credit. The right reverend Prelate also spoke about that. This part of the amendment is particularly necessary given that rates of support for children in this group are already intended to be halved under universal credit. At present, families with a disabled child for whom they are in receipt of some level of disability living allowance may be entitled to receive support through the disability element of child tax credit, currently worth &#163;57 a week. Under universal credit, that support is to be provided through disability additions within household benefit entitlements. But it is proposed to cut this support in half to just &#163;28 a week. This change will affect all families with a disabled child unless the child is receiving the high-rate care component of the DLA or is registered blind.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/12">In Committee, I spoke about the evidence in the <I>Holes in the </I><I>S</I><I>afety </I><I>N</I><I>et </I>review from the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, of the impact of universal credit on disabled people and their families. I will not repeat the detail now but, in a word, it was that the effects would be disastrous. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates a growth in the number of children living in poverty of 400,000 between 2011 and 2015 and 800,000 by 2020. The Minister said in Committee that we cannot set too much store by such predictions because we do not know what direction government policy will take. But government policy seems to follow only a one-way direction of travel in this regard. We do know that the Government intend to take a further &#163;10 billion out of welfare. The upshot of that can be only one thing: more child poverty. This measure can only serve to increase that; indeed, the Government have acknowledged that it will add 200,000 to the numbers of children in poverty-100,000 of them in working households.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/13">The Children's Society estimates that the cost of removing child disability addition from the cap would be just &#163;2.4 million in 2014-15 and &#163;4.2 million in 2015-16. In the scale of public expenditure, that is a trifling sum and I really hope that the Government see their way to thinking again on this aspect of my amendment at least.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.1/14">The case for the amendment is compelling. It seeks to do no more than the Government already claim to have done by exempting from the cap a particularly vulnerable group among those who receive benefits-disabled people-and I hope that the House will support it. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.531.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100082" speakername="Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville" colon=":" colnum="531"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_99">
	<p pid="a.531.0/1">My Lords, my noble friend Lord Deben is not in the Chamber although I had a word with him outside. I am not sure that he was fair in asking the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon where he would find the money on the previous amendment. However, when we get into the guts of this amendment, it would be reasonable to expect the Official Opposition at that stage to explain where they would find it.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.0/2">My memory goes back to Grand Committee on a couple of Bills in the final two years of the previous Government. They were held in the Moses Room; one was on housing and the other was on planning. I recall that the second one occurred in the very first week of the then Governor of the Bank of England-who is still the governor-who expressed anxiety that a recession was now becoming a real possibility. I asked why the Government, in their explanation of the text of the respective Bills on housing and planning, thought that future conditions would be like conditions in the past. I was told by both the Minister and knowledgeable government Back-Benchers in Grand Committee that I was not to worry my head about these things. There was no acceptance that the economic ice was beginning to thin and, specifically, I was told that the recession had not yet happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.0/3">It was only later that I recalled a new year message in the 1950s or 1960s in the <I>Observer</I> by its essayist Paul Jennings in his weekly article. He explained that the new year had come in over a weekend and he had therefore had the opportunity to use the weekend to explore in his diary what the publishers thought he needed to know in the coming year, which they had not supplied in the previous one. It transpired that the answer was the thickness of ice. He explained that he was now in a position to tell the <I>Observer</I>'s readers that you required half an inch of ice to sustain a duck and an inch of ice to sustain an infant, going up in a series of categories until you reached 16 inches for a County-class locomotive and 24 inches for a regiment of foot. It was on reaching the statistic for a regiment of foot that Mr Jennings began to wonder how they knew. He imagined a scene in the Crimea when not much else was happening. The same young Mr Hemmings who took part in the film &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; was riding up to Lord Raglan with the news that they had just lost another battalion of the Grenadiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.0/4">If I move from that analogy to the departure of the previous Government, I recall that Mr Byrne, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, left a note for his successor saying that there was no more money. As a message, that seems to me as daunting for a new Chief Secretary as the news to Lord Raglan that he had lost a battalion of the Grenadiers during what must have been the Crimean War. It is therefore reasonable to ask the Official Opposition where they would find the money for their support for this amendment. Indeed, perhaps the Official Opposition might express some regret for their mistakes in government and explain to the Bench of Bishops what went wrong in their economic policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.0/5">In the same context as the intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths, I shall personally look forward in the hope that we will be able to come back to that subject on a future amendment, in which I would much enjoy joining with him.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.532.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="532"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#st_100">
	<p pid="a.532.0/1">My Lords, we have added our names to this amendment moved so comprehensively by the noble Lord, Lord Low. It requires that all the components of ESA-the personal allowance and the additional component for those in the work-related activity group, as well as those in the support group-are taken outside the 1% cap on uprating. As we have heard, the amendment rightly includes provision for children to be made under universal credit, although it remains to be seen how much progress the faltering universal credit will have made by the time the Bill is spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.532.0/2">As we have argued on previous amendments, it is the vulnerable who are most affected by the Bill. This is particularly so for those on ESA for two specific reasons. They are much less able to increase their income through work and their living costs are generally higher. This is particularly so for those in the support group, who are furthest from the labour market, but also for those in the WRAG. It is worth remembering that there is a rigorous testing process for people who are unable to work due to ill health or disability. We know that the gateway to this benefit is tough. Although the process involving Atos has been improved, there are still many who end up on ESA only after a successful appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.532.0/3">Although individuals in the WRAG are closer to the labour market through their conditionality or otherwise, the route to paid work is not easy, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, said. We know that the Work Programme has not covered itself in glory in this regard. As things currently stand, individuals in the WRAG will lose something like &#163;191 a year by 2015 as a result of this Bill. Those in the support group will fare little better in terms of income, being some &#163;138 a year worse off by that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.532.0/4">Macmillan has specifically drawn our attention to how these measures will affect people with cancer. Its estimate is that in excess of 40,000 cancer patients will be claiming ESA by 2015 with the presumption that they will be placed in the support group. Macmillan particularly stresses the impact of rising energy bills on this group. Like the noble Lord, Lord Low, I remind the Secretary of State that he should fulfil his commitment to make sure that people on ESA are being fully protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.532.0/5">The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, challenged me to say where we think the money should come from. I thought I made it clear in the first debate that we think the Government should not proceed with the tax cut that is proposed for those earning &#163;150,000 a year. The proposed tax cut from 50% to 45% would be a source of revenue. The Government say that this will not produce very much, but that assumes that people can get away with planning their income to defeat the thrust of that change. If the Government are alert to that, they could garner that revenue and we believe they should.</p>
	<p pid="a.532.0/6">There is a wider argument about the extent of debt that can be sustained. The point I come back to is that the greater the failure of the Government in their economic policy-the greater the paucity or lack of growth in the economy-the more it will be necessary for the Government to borrow. If the Government can get growth back into the economy, that begins to ease the debt burden. There is another source there.</p>
	<p pid="a.532.0/7">I also remind the noble Lord that these amendments take ESA out of the fixed uprating-the collar that this Bill puts around them-so a judgment would have to be made for each uprating period. Traditionally and rightly that has been an increase by the rate of inflation of one sort of another. That is what these amendments are doing. They are not technically, of themselves, proposing a different rate, although I made it clear that we support uprating by inflation for the year that we are about to enter.</p>
	<p pid="a.532.0/8">It is clear from that combination of reasons that this proposal can and should be supported. It is not constrained by the economic position of the Government. It is the Government that have got themselves into a bind because they have failed to generate growth in the economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.534.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100348" speakername="Lord King of Bridgwater" colon=":" colnum="534"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_101">
	<p pid="a.534.0/1">As the noble Lord understands some of the complexities of this matter which many others may find more difficult, what does he assess the cost of this amendment would be over the next few years?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.534.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="534"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_102">
	<p pid="a.534.1/1">The total cost is certainly less than that proposed for the totality of the arrangements in the Bill. It would be a portion of that. The number of people in the support group is something like 200,000 and there are around 300,000 in the WRAG. If you assumed you were looking at a difference between uprating by inflation and uprating by 1%, that would be the calculation. I stress that this amendment is saying that you simply take ESA out of the 1% collar, and it leaves open the question of whether uprating next year and the year after should be by whatever inflation is then. However, this amendment does not put a figure on it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.534.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100348" speakername="Lord King of Bridgwater" colon=":" colnum="534"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_103">
	<p pid="a.534.2/1">The noble Lord is a signatory to this amendment. He is speaking for the Official Opposition and it obviously represents a cost. I wonder what that cost is. I do not see how the House can vote if it is not clear what extra costs are envisaged. If he is suggesting that there is no extra cost at all, I do not imagine the Government will find great difficulty with the amendment. Presumably there is a cost; I wonder if he knows the figure.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.534.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="534"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_104">
	<p pid="a.534.3/1">It depends on what the alternative proposition would be. I have tried to stress that this amendment takes ESA outside this 1% fixed uprating-outside that collar-so we would have to judge the impact at each uprating period thereafter. A judgment would have to be made in the light of inflation and general economic circumstances at that point in time. That seems a very clear proposition, is it not? It is certainly a basis on which we are very happy to support this amendment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.534.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101091" speakername="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" colon=":" colnum="534"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_105">
	<p pid="a.534.4/1">My Lords, all of us want to protect those who are furthest from the labour market or who have additional costs because of disability, and I think that all of us who have contributed to this debate so far and all of us in the Chamber today share that view. There is no disagreement among us on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/2">That is what the Government are doing. We have not included key disability benefits, including disability living allowance and attendance allowance in the 1% annual uprating decision in the Bill. Nor have we included the disability premiums in working age benefits or the disability elements of tax credits in the Bill. We have also excluded the support group component of employment and support allowance and the higher of the universal credit disabled child additions. All these benefits will continue to be uprated by CPI. We have protected them because they help support those who are furthest from the labour market or who have additional costs because of disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/3">In one of the exchanges that has just taken place, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, referred to cancer sufferers and made the point that we want to make sure that we provide them with the support that they need. It is worth reminding noble Lords that earlier this year, in January in fact, we introduced changes that will mean that more people with cancer will now qualify for the support group, which is protected, whereas before they might have been placed in the work-related activity group. We have taken on board the concerns in that area. They were valid concerns, and we were glad to be able to act on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/4">Let me explain, however, why we have included the personal allowance and the work-related activity component of ESA in the Bill. The ESA personal allowance, which is subject to the 1% cap, is there to provide temporary basic support for everyday needs. It does not reflect disability or the additional costs of disability: hence it is set at the same rate as the personal allowance for the other working-age benefits such as jobseeker's allowance, income support and housing benefit. The work-related activity group component-the additional component on top of the personal allowance-which is also subject to the 1% cap, is paid to those who are able to take steps to prepare for a return to work. As such, they will be referred for appropriate support, training and provision to ensure that they get the help that they need. It is the support group component that is paid in recognition of the fact that more severely ill and disabled people are less likely to be able to increase their income by moving into work and may have additional needs. That is why it is paid at a higher rate than the WRAG component, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, referred to it, and why it has been excluded from the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/5">I will give noble Lords some comparison. The WRAG component goes on top of the personal allowance, which for a single person at the moment is &#163;71 per week. For those who are considered perhaps to be ready, with some support, to be able to start thinking about moving back into work, that is &#163;28.15 a week at today's rate, while the support component is currently &#163;34.05 a week. The noble Lord, Lord Low, questioned whether we were right to describe the work-related activity component of ESA as a temporary benefit. He may find it helpful if I remind him and other noble Lords that when the last Government introduced ESA-it was a new benefit that they brought in-the Command Paper that they published said:</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/6">&quot;For the vast majority, ESA will be a temporary benefit as people recover from, or adapt to, their condition and prepare for a return to work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/7">It also said that the support group should be the element that provides,</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/8" class="indent">&quot;security for the most severely disabled people&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/9">That is what the then Government set out when they introduced the new benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/10">Reference has been made to universal credit and to the component of it that is paid to parents of disabled children. In universal credit, a similar distinction is drawn between people who are in what we are currently calling the WRAG group and those who are in the support group: hence, the disabled child additions and their adult equivalents in universal credit are to be paid at a lower and a higher rate. The lower rate of the disabled child addition reflects that the parents are more able, with the right support, to move towards work. That is why it is part of this Bill. It is a payment that is made to the parents of children. However, the higher rate of the disabled child addition reflects the fact that parents of a severely disabled child who are entitled to the higher rate may not be able to increase their incomes through work. That is why it is not part of the Bill. That distinction is mirrored across into universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/11">However, because I recognise the concerns that noble Lords have raised, I will stress again that the personal allowance-the payments for which increases will be capped at 1%-are not those that are paid to cover the additional costs associated with a person's disability. There are fundamental distinctions here between additional cost disability benefits, such as DLA, which we have protected, and employment and support allowance; between the ESA support group component, which we have protected, and the WRAG and the personal allowance; and, finally, between parents providing care to a child receiving the higher rate of the universal credit disabled child addition, which we have protected, and the lower rate that is paid to parents who, with some support, could return to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/12">Because all of us are concerned to see disabled people receive the support they need, it might be helpful for me to outline for noble Lords some of the wider support that the Government provide for disabled people. The Government are spending nearly &#163;50 billion a year supporting disabled people. One of the ways in which we are doing this is by investing &#163;320 million on disability employment programmes. I hear the comments that were made by the noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord McKenzie, about the Work Programme, but I disagree with them. I would also say that we have a scheme for disabled people called Access to Work, which in 2011-12 supported over 30,000 people at an average cost of over &#163;3,200. We have invested more, another &#163;15 million, in this area for this spending review. We have another programme called Work Choice, which provides tailored support to help disabled people facing the most complex barriers to employment find and stay in work. It is voluntary, and payable regardless of any benefits being claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/13">I know that many noble Lords are very familiar with the detail of different benefits that apply to disabled people and have been involved in debates and decisions in this area for many years. None the less, it is worth me making the wider point that the latest OECD figures show that the Government spend a higher proportion of GDP on disabled people's benefits and services compared with the rest of the EU. Of 34 countries, only Norway and Iceland spend more. We take this responsibility very seriously and ensure that the support that disabled people rightly need is provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/14">This Bill seeks to make savings where we can, while protecting benefits that reflect additional costs. The Bill is expected to create savings of around &#163;3 billion over the two years in question. My noble friend Lord King asked the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, whether he was aware of the cost of the amendment that we are debating. It would reduce those savings by around &#163;400 million, which would clearly put additional pressures on public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.4/15">I believe that our proposals are proportionate and fair. I recognise, of course, that there are people who are affected by the changes that we are making here, but I hope that I have been able to demonstrate that, when seen in the wider context, we are also providing comprehensive support to people who are disabled, which is right and which we will continue to do. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord, Lord Low, feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.537.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100928" speakername="Lord Low of Dalston" colon=":" colnum="537"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_106">
	<p pid="a.537.0/1">I am grateful to all those who have spoken and to the Minister for her full reply. A fair amount of the discussion has been taken up with where we are going to get the money. It is certainly not my job to answer for the Opposition as to where they would get the money from, but I would say here that without wanting to open up a general discussion again on the management of the economy, especially at this stage of the debate, I do take the view that you can borrow your way out of a recession. This is a paradox, of course, and it is not clear how it is the case at first blush. However, running a national economy, where one person's expenditure cut is a cut in someone else's income, is different from running a domestic economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/2">There is a clear difference of view here with those on the Benches to my left. I am not an economist but I would ask people to accept that there is a very respectable and quite populous strand of opinion that supports the proposition that I have just enunciated. It is not so self-evidently barmy, as was suggested earlier in the debate, to say that the Government would be able to meet the cost of these amendments by borrowing more. There is respectable opinion to support that. To those who say that the Government are already more in debt and borrowing more than they would like to be, I simply say that there is no reason why they should not borrow a bit more. If the amount of extra borrowing that they are engaging in is still not achieving lift-off for the economy, they just have to borrow a bit more until they do. I know that that will not commend itself to this side of the House, but it is a respectable point of view and it is the position that I take.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/3">We have been asked about the cost of the amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has said quite clearly, that obviously depends on a range of factors. One of those factors is certainly the rate of inflation. Therefore, it cannot be precisely quantified. In any case, the question about what we would do to get the extra money is answered by what I have already said in response to the Minister. A more pertinent question than how one would find the money is when one would find the money. The answer of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie-a year at a time-is perfectly reasonable. Labour is prepared to say that it would uprate at the rate of inflation in the first year that we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.0/4">The only other thing I want to say in response to the Minister is that the Government have essentially been peddling a myth when they say that they are protecting disabled people in this Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill. They are only partially doing so. The Government ought to be straight with the British people. I repeat: they are only partially protecting disabled people. It is because I believe that the Government should deliver on their pledge to fully protect disabled people with this benefits uprating measure that I have brought this amendment to the House. It is also why I ask the House to support it, and why I would like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.541.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100843" speakername="Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope" colon=":" colnum="541"  time="018:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_108">
	<p pid="a.541.1/1">My Lords, my Amendments 4 and 9 in this group take us into much lighter territory. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, will understand and relax, because the purpose of the amendments is not to attack the savings which it is the principal purpose of the Bill to achieve but only to protect the position of benefit recipients should the Office for Budget Responsibility's estimates for inflation be exceeded by 3%, which is the figure that I have chosen for the purposes of the amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/2">The amendments are different from those which have gone before because, apart from anything else, they are much less susceptible to attack on grounds of financial privilege. A problem that I had with some of the earlier amendments, and I share some of the analysis, was that they were prone to attack on those grounds. I think that those of us who participated in consideration during the passage of the Welfare Reform Act last year felt that financial privilege was being used rather rashly in the other place, but the purpose of this House is to persuade the House of Commons perhaps to think again about some of the legislation that comes to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/3">Amendment 4 would simply disapply the 1% limit on benefit uprating in the event of inflation reaching 3%. I would be interested in the view on this of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, because he knows a lot more about it than do. Judging where inflation will come out in September 2013 and September 2014 is an inexact science. We will learn tomorrow what the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Chancellor think about the situation, but the two years covered in the Bill, September 2013-14 and September 2014-15, are considered to be facing inflation increases of 2.6% and 2.2% respectively. The purpose of the amendment is to ask what happens if those estimates are wrong. They are forecasts; they are not scientifically worked through. We have therefore to ask ourselves what we do as a legislature if inflation reaches 3%.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/4">Change in the real-terms value of benefits is very sensitive to inflationary increases. I have said that the Office for Budget Responsibility's baseline is 2.6% for September 2013 and 2.2% for September 2014. That reduces the real value of benefits by 4% and produces a saving of &#163;3 billion; that is already agreed and is in the Bill. However, checking Library figures, I am advised that if inflation exceeds Office for Budget Responsibility estimates by 1% in the two years covered by the Bill, it will reduce the real value of benefits in the hands of claimants by 6% and result in a windfall saving to the Treasury not of &#163;3 billion, which is what the deficit reduction programme is looking for, but of &#163;5.1 billion. You can multiply the figures. If the OBR baseline is exceeded by 2%, that reduces the real value of benefits by 8% and produces a windfall saving for the Treasury of &#163;7.2 billion. I have no way of knowing whether any of that will happen. All I seek with this amendment is to ask what the Government will do if it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/5">The financial context is slightly worrying and has been getting worse since the coalition Government promulgated this policy some months ago. We will learn more about this in the Budget tomorrow. The Budget may well be-and some of us will argue that it should be-looking to promote growth and loosen some of the constraints on inflation that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is required to oversee. However, we have a Bank Governor-designate in Mr Mark Carney, who comes with a reputation of being prepared to live with higher levels of inflation. If that happens, then the 3% figure in the amendment may well be breached sooner rather than later. In some of the earlier debates the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, rightly adverted to the fact that the markets are already pricing in higher inflation in the short term over the two years that the Bill covers.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/6">As a legislature, we now face an increasing risk of inflation for these two financial years; I put it no higher than that. We very much need to take that into account. The CPI calculation of inflation is a national figure, worked out with average figures on a statistical basis, but someone said to me the other day that childcare costs have gone up 6%, as anybody who has studied the incidence of rising costs on low-income families will know. That is a long way in excess of the general CPI rates that we face, as with food prices, rents and energy prices, particularly for the low-income families that I am concerned about.</p>
	<p pid="a.541.1/7">I am grateful to my noble friend for the considerable discussion that we had about this. He was generous in considering what I said, but it would be helpful if the House knew what the Government would do if the 3% inflation figure was breached. I am reasonably content that there are overriding powers in the Social Security Acts, but I do not think there are in the Tax Credits Acts; I might be wrong about that. What happens if something untoward happens to inflation and we end up in the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years with something unexpected suddenly coming over the horizon? Surely some of these reductions in the value of benefits that I have alluded to would be quite unconscionable as a windfall increase to the Treasury's coffers in a way that is not intended, as I understand it, but may well happen by mistake?</p>

	<p pid="a.543.0/1">I have looked carefully at my noble friend's amendment and listened to his speech with care, but he does not provide the remedy in the amendment. It simply says that the uprating limited to 1% is cancelled if inflation reaches 3%. Would he indicate why he chose 3% and what the remedy would be? If he specifies a remedy, then we are back into the argument about cost.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.543.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100843" speakername="Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope" colon=":" colnum="543"  time="018:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_110">
	<p pid="a.543.1/1">The remedy would simply be that if 3% was breached, then the clauses in the Bill fall and there would be the default position of an annual uprating process. It would be at the Secretary of State's discretion with the usual provisions of Section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. It would be taken year by year and would say that inflation was forging ahead in an unforeseen way. For myself, I would listen to an argument that said that we should stick to 1% on costs shown in those circumstances, but if 3% was breached we would go back to the status quo. That does not have a cost at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/2">The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, and I have been doing government uprating statements for 30 years together and I have never known a Government not get an uprating statement that they wanted if they had a majority. That is what I think would happen in these circumstances. However, the Secretary of State would be obliged to come back and say to both Houses that the circumstances were not what he had anticipated or what the Office of Budget Responsibility had calculated and that therefore there would be a chance for reconsideration. That is all I ask.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/3">In fact, Clause 1(5) and Clause 2(4) of the Bill give the Treasury power to protect itself from the downside. These clauses say that if inflation falls below 1% it will not admit the full 1% uprating and will reserve the right to adjust it. Yet there is no limit to which the Treasury will allow inflation to increase before it comes back and argues its case in Parliament one way or the other. There is a 50:50 chance of this happening. I believe in my heart of hearts that the Government would respond to that. I do not believe it would be at all conscionable to leave 3.5% or 4% inflation with these 1% caps for the two years in this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/4">We need more than that. We need some inflation-proofing and protection for recipients of benefits in the two years covered by the Bill if inflation races ahead. That is the burden of the argument. It is no more and no less than that. I do not think that it would be attacked on the grounds of financial privilege. It has no direct effect, as I see it, on deficit reduction. I am content that the Government get &#163;3 billion in savings, but not content that they get &#163;5 billion or &#163;7 billion, because that is not what the Bill is designed to do. I argue in this amendment that there is no protection in particular for low-income families. I hope that my noble friend will give me some reassurance about what the Government will do in these eventualities. If he is not prepared to accept this amendment, I may well be tempted to test the opinion of the House. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.544.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101149" speakername="Baroness Morgan of Drefelin" colon=":" colnum="544"  time="018:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_111">
	<p pid="a.544.0/1">My Lords, I am not an economist. I declare an interest as chief executive of a cancer research charity. My concerns are similar to those voiced by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. The Bill locks in the 1% and does not contain a very important review provision. I am sure that my amendment is so anodyne that the Minister will say either that it is unnecessary or that he will accept it.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.0/2">For that reason, I will be brief. It is important once more to challenge the myth that disabled people will be protected from the measures in the Bill when that is so clearly not the case. Let us remember that, by 2015, in excess of 40,000 cancer patients will be claiming ESA. It is the main benefit claimed by cancer patients, as we have already heard. For those cancer patients in the support group, only a proportion, the support component, of what they receive, will be protected, while their core payment will rise by only 1%, as my noble friend Lord Low mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.0/3">Overall, cancer patients in the support group will see their ESA payments rise by only 1.4%, rather than by inflation, and Macmillan Cancer Support has estimated that, by 2015, cancer patients will be &#163;138 worse off each year than if they had received the 2.2% rise which could have been expected with the CPI level as was in September 2012. I cite the &#163;138 figure, but I am conscious that we do not yet know the true effect of the Bill. That figure shows how far ESA will fall behind inflation if the consumer prices index were to remain at the September 2012 level of 2.2%. However, it has now risen to 2.7%. If, as we have heard, inflation were to rise to 3% over the next three years, the loss to cancer patients and others in the ESA support group would be even greater. The actual impact on cancer patients and others supported by those payments is just as uncertain as the level of inflation itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.544.0/4">In its current form, the Bill leaves no flexibility to protect vulnerable groups such as cancer patients if there is a significant rise in inflation over the next three years. For that reason, I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. I fully expect the Minister to say that he will accept my amendment or that it is unnecessary because it is a matter of course that there will be a review by the Social Security Advisory Committee if we have such a rise in inflation. I very much look forward to hearing the Minister's remarks about how the Government aim to continue to protect cancer patients as much as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.545.0/1">I should have asked my noble Lord friend Lord Kirkwood, this; he is an expert on uprating. The noble Baroness said that this is an anodyne amendment. I am not an expert on how uprating works, but does her amendment provide that if inflation is above 3%, the Bill does not apply and it will then be up to the Secretary of State to decide what increase he tries to get through both Houses of Parliament, which could in fact be 1%, if the economic situation is as it is? So it does not automatically provide that the current rate of inflation has to be included. Have I got that right?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.545.1/1">That is correct. As normal, the House would receive an annual uprating SI, there would be a debate in the normal way and, if the Government of the day wanted to propose a particular uprating, there would be the normal impact assessment. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, may want to clarify his amendment, but my amendment states that if we have a significant increase in inflation, we need the experts to conduct a review to say what will be the impact on benefit recipients.</p>

	<p pid="a.545.2/1">My Lords, I have my name to Amendment 12. I support what my noble friend Lady Morgan of Drefelin said.</p>
	<p pid="a.545.2/2">The Bill could see vulnerable cancer patients and other seriously ill patients losing out on almost &#163;500 per year if inflation rises. That is a great deal of money for people who are not working and who are ill. I hope that the Minister will give some hope that those vulnerable people will not suffer and that he will support this helpful amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.545.5/2">I must congratulate my noble friend Lord Kirkwood on this very ingenious amendment.

	<p pid="a.545.6/1">Since the noble Lord asked, let me tell him. I am looking him straight in the eye.

	<p pid="a.546.0/1">The noble Lord and I both have our crosses to bear in the coalition. I am grateful for his confirmation that he does not support the principle. This is just a very clever device to try to get us back to where we started from without making a commitment to spend money. The amendment states that the provisions in the Bill which limit the benefit increases to 1% can be set aside if inflation reaches 3%. That is for very good reasons. The noble Lord argues the case about people on low incomes and the effects of inflation. The noble Baronesses, Lady Morgan and Lady Masham, in their amendment, have highlighted the desperate impact that inflation has on cancer patients who are not working.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.0/2">The best way to protect those people is to ensure that inflation does not rise to 3%. The idea that it is inevitable that inflation will rise to 3% is deeply damaging.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.0/3">If the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, wishes to interrupt, I will be happy to give way, but otherwise I would be grateful if he did not make remarks from a sedentary position, which is distracting me from my argument-which of course, was his intention.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.0/4">The best way to protect people is not to have inflation. One thing that sets inflation running uncontrollably is people's expectations of inflation. When the noble Lord makes a speech saying, &quot;I think that inflation is going to be more than 3%&quot;, people hear that and think, in their wage negotiations, &quot;Lord Kirkwood says that it will be more than 3%; the Government say that it will be two and a bit per cent&quot;. Expectations drive the inflation rate, and inflation is devastating for the poorest in our society and for people on fixed incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.0/5">Therefore, we need to follow a policy that will limit the possibility of large increases in inflation. That is where we have a problem. To do that, we must show that we have control of public expenditure and have plans in place that can be relied on.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.0/6">If the amendment were accepted, anyone looking at the Government's plans for financial responsibility over the next two years would say, &quot;They have marked down that social security and benefit payments will be this, but, of course, because of Lord Kirkwood's amendment we cannot rely on that because if inflation is above that figure, the Secretary of State will need to take a decision&quot;. They will note that he will be taking a decision in the run-up to an election and will therefore draw conclusions about what the pressures on the Secretary of State might be.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.0/7">The amendment drives a coach and horses through the Government's finances for anyone looking at whether they can rely on the Government delivering.</p>

	<p pid="a.546.2/1">Yes, got it in one. The one thing that we learnt in the 1970s was that indexation, like other palliatives, is absolutely disastrous, because it sets the ball rolling, which gets faster and faster with people chasing inflation. Of course that is exactly what I am arguing.</p>

	<p pid="a.547.0/1">If the noble Lord follows that argument through, is he therefore saying that, should inflation happen, that is just tough luck, and the poor cannot not have the possibility of any protection from the Secretary of State doing what he would now do, which is to consider all the options under the circumstances?</p>

	<p pid="a.547.1/2">We have to contain public expenditure not to within our means, because we are spending more than our means; the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, pointed out that the Government are already borrowing and spending &#163;200 billion more than was planned. I am simply arguing that if we continue like this the pound will continue to sink. The cost of energy, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood pointed out, is a major cost for families, will go up. He supports windmills and other energy forms of energy generation that are the most expensive known to the planet and which are put on people's bills without their knowledge as a tax and add to the pressure on these families. That is another example of where, if he is worried about poor households, he should abandon his attachment to windmills and other things that are raising energy costs and adding to inflation. The name of the game is to contain inflation by not having daft policies such as windmills and other energy policies. It is to act in a responsible way so that people will not decide that they do not wish to buy government debt, which is already a problem, and will not result in further pressure on the exchange rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.1/3">I am sympathetic to the points that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, has made and with which the noble Baronesses, Lady Morgan and Lady Masham, are concerned in respect of the people who are affected. The problem is that the remedy that they propose would make things much worse. It is not a good place to be. We would prefer not to have started from here, but it was Mr Gordon Brown who put us in this position, ably assisted by the noble Baroness, and we must sort this mess out. Clever as it is, this amendment is a smart attempt to get round the basic purpose of the Bill, which is fundamental to protecting people on low incomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.547.2/1">I support the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, but I want to go one step further. He has dealt incredibly effectively with the measured arguments put forward by my noble friend Lord Kirkwood in Amendment 9, but it does not quite hit the interesting amendment in the names of the noble Baronesses, Lady Morgan and Lady Masham. I want to make a couple of points drawn from the Office for Budget Responsibility report looking at this Bill and the impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/2">Front and foremost are two things. The first is the control of inflation and the second is the creation of employment. They will help the poor more than anything else. If we fail to tackle the debt, the cost of borrowing will rise, as my noble friend Lord Forsyth has said. If the cost of borrowing rises, inflation will rise on the back of it. Therefore it follows that tackling the deficit is the best thing that can be done to help the poor. In table 2 on page 6 of its forecast, the OBR estimates that inflation will be: 2.6% in 2013-14; 2.2% in 2014-15; 2% in 2015-16; and 2% in 2016-17 and thereafter. It is clearly assessing that the culmination of the effect of these and other measures being taken is to move us towards a situation in which inflation is on a steadily downward course. That is the OBR's assessment, which was used as the basis of the 2012 Autumn Budget Statement. As noble Lords have said, we will find out tomorrow where we stand vis-&#224;-vis that.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/3">Other elements need to be taken into account. We have the Low Pay Commission's report coming up shortly. The Low Pay Commission provides a report that influences the minimum wage. The report was submitted at the end of February. I do not know whether my noble friends on the Front Bench have had sight of that recommendation, but it, too, provides a lock. Despite in previous incarnations being against the minimum wage, the Government have said that they support the minimum wage and have always accepted the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission to increase income as a result. Taking that together with the changes to universal credit that are deemed to be providing additional benefits to people estimated at &#163;168 a month for 3 million families and the likely increase in tax thresholds and their impact on the salaries and incomes of the poorest in our society, it seems fair and reasonable, as the noble Baronesses, Lady Morgan and Lady Masham, have suggested, periodically to undertake a review. Post-implementation reviews normally take place three to five years after implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/4">We are talking about some of the most vulnerable. I believe that the position affecting the poorest in our society will not be as great as some people anticipate and that the situation with the combination of policies that I have outlined will lead to an increase, but as we are not having the annual uprating review, some periodic review of how this is working against projections of inflation and of the impact on the poorest in society, would be sensible. I encourage my noble friends on the Front Bench to support it if possible. Should such a review take place, it should not need focus on the one narrow measure that has been the theme of this debate but should assess the wider impact on the poorest in society, taking into account the other measures-the pupil premium, NHS, the lid on fuel increases, the increase in personal allowances, the increase in the national minimum wage et cetera-which we are talking about. With that, I support the noble Baroness, but I am, afraid not, my noble friend Lord Kirkwood.</p>

	<p pid="a.549.0/1">My Lords, let me make it clear that we support each of these amendments. The request in the amendment in the name of the noble Baronesses, Lady Morgan of Drefelin and Lady Masham of Ilton, that there should be a review seems modest and straightforward. If the Government should seek to resist that, or a reasonable and clear alternative, I would be amazed.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.0/2">The case is the same with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. As I understand the proposition, he is saying that should in any year the current expectations of inflation be in excess of 3%, which we currently expect to be the case, the 1% automatic uprating would not apply and there has to be an annual assessment, as happens at the moment. That assessment might lead to a 1% uprating, or to some other form of uprating, but there would not be the automatic application of 1%. Who knows what will happen to inflation? I do not predict that there will be a surge in inflation but, if were to be, is any level of real cut in the standard of living of poor people acceptable to the Government? Is that what they are saying? They would be if they rejected this amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.549.2/1">We are talking about specific provisions in the Bill about the uprating of benefits. The noble Lord has worked quite hard to differentiate himself from the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and his amendments. The suggestion that somehow having this provision in the Bill will fuel wage inflation across the land, fuel expectations up and down the country and bring the economy to a halt is, frankly, frivolous and a nonsense. The noble Lord knows that full well. He is an experienced parliamentarian and an able debater, but I do not believe that he did himself justice in the way he sought to pick away at the noble Lord's amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.549.3/1">I was asking the noble Lord a straightforward question. He is enunciating the principle that if inflation were at 3% or more, it would be necessary to abandon a position that held the increase in benefits to 1%. I am simply saying that if that is the Opposition's view, is it also their view in respect of public sector pay? If inflation turned out to be much higher, would the same apply to people working in the public sector? If not, why not?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.549.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="549"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_129">
	<p pid="a.549.4/1">My Lords, we are debating a different Bill. If the noble Lord wants to debate a proposition about public sector pay, let us have some propositions and we can consider that. The noble Lord knows full well that he is trying to lead the Opposition in a particular direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.4/2">I come back to the point that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, is very straightforward. It just says that an automatic 1% uprating would not apply automatically if inflation reached a certain level. That seems entirely unobjectionable and I cannot see why the Government cannot accept it. If the Government do not accept it, they have to say what level of inflation, what level of real decrease in people's circumstances, they would find acceptable, because that would be the consequence of rejecting the amendment. This is a very modest proposition. I really am surprised at the trouble that the Government are having with accepting it. I would hope at least that the noble Lord's colleagues would stick with him on this issue as the arguments that we have heard against it are quite spurious.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.550.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100453" speakername="Lord Newby" colon=":" colnum="550"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_130">
	<p pid="a.550.0/1">My Lords, the first amendment in this group in the name of my noble friend Lord Kirkwood would mean that the Bill would apply only if inflation was below 3% for the purposes of uprating in that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.0/2">I shall provide a reminder of what the official inflation forecasts currently show. While inflation is forecast to be above target-that is, 2% in the near term-it will fall back towards the target in the medium term. In the final year of the Bill, the current forecasts show that inflation for the purposes of uprating in that year will be 2.2%. That was the view of the Office for Budget Responsibility at the time of the Autumn Statement. The OBR produces independent and authoritative forecasts for the economy and public finances and we take decisions based on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.0/3">However, the OBR is not alone in forecasting that inflation will fall back to target in the medium term. That is also the view of other major economic forecasters. I refer to the IMF, the OECD and the Bank of England. Indeed, the latest assessment of independent forecasters in February was that UK inflation would be 2.2% in the 12 months to quarter 1 of 2014 and in the 12 months to quarter 1 of 2015. That is an average assessment of people who make their living by doing this job.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that he thought there was a 50% chance of inflation being over 3% in the period covered by the Bill. I remind the House that that means a 50% chance that inflation will be over 3% by September 2014, because that is the last point at which the Bill has an effect in terms of benefit uprating. All I can say to my noble friend, for whom I have the greatest regard, is that his view is just not shared by any reputable international or national body that is making forecasts about inflation.</p>

	<p pid="a.550.1/1">In that case, why do the Government have any problem in accepting this amendment?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.550.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100453" speakername="Lord Newby" colon=":" colnum="550"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_132">
	<p pid="a.550.2/1">I am coming on to that. In fact, I will deal with it now. It is relevant to the point that was made by my noble friend Lord Forsyth. The purpose of the Bill, as we have debated about 20 times since Second Reading, is to give some certainty to the Government's fiscal plans. The reason we are doing that is that a number of international bodies and rating agencies have said that this has a specific and significant impact on the way that they view the UK's prospects. Entrenching something in a Bill has the effect of giving a degree of certainty, which is immensely useful with regard to the markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.2/2">As my noble friend Lord Forsyth has said, there seems to be a sense that the markets think that we in the UK are in a very good position and that a little tweak here and there in terms of borrowing will make no difference. That is not the way the markets work. It starts off with a little tweak and then the markets feel that something is going wrong. Once that feeling takes hold, the markets can move very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.2/3">As we have debated many times in your Lordships' House, it does not need much of an increase in inflation to make a huge difference to the Government's finances and the lives of ordinary people.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.551.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="551"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_133">
	<p pid="a.551.0/1">Can the noble Lord tell me how the markets have moved in response to the Government borrowing &#163;200 billion more than originally planned?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.551.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100453" speakername="Lord Newby" colon=":" colnum="551"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_134">
	<p pid="a.551.1/1">The reason why they have not moved is that the Government have not changed our underlying policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/2">The effect of a 1% increase in inflation on someone with a &#163;100,000 mortgage is &#163;1,000. These are big differences and a 1% increase in the interest rate is by no means out of line with the interest rates being paid by a raft of European countries whose borrowing as a percentage of GDP is significantly less than ours. The risk in terms of interest rates is real and present. It is not some airy-fairy possibility that would come into play only if the Government were suddenly to go mad and spend huge amounts of money. It can happen with a relatively small change.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/3">The Government remain committed to low and stable inflation. As we have said umpteen times, it is good for individuals and for business and is a prerequisite for economic prosperity. That is why the Government set the remit for the independent Monetary Policy Committee to target inflation. The Chancellor will set the remit at Budget tomorrow, as usual. I do not know what the remit will be but I know it will not be, to quote my noble friend Lord Kirkwood, to loosen the constraints so that inflation rips. I am confident that the Government's commitment to low inflation will remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/4">My noble friend Lord Kirkwood and the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, said, &quot;What happens if, contrary to what the Government have said, inflation does rip? Suppose we have a circumstance that we don't believe is going to happen&quot;. If Governments legislated for every circumstance that they did not believe was going to happen, we would have Bills thousands of pages long. The Government can legislate and act only on the basis of a central assumption of what the future, in respect of the particular area of public policy they are dealing with, is going to be like, and that is what we have done here.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/5">I turn to the issue that many people have faced and in many cases continue to face-real-terms reductions in pay. Inflation risk is something that everyone has to face in everyday life. We have been taking about public servants but let us just talk about them a bit more. Public servants have seen their pay frozen and then increased by 1%. When inflation rose to 5.2% in September 2011, many public servants were in the middle of a pay freeze. The Opposition supported that policy and there was no inflation guarantee within it. This includes, for example, many hard-pressed personal advisers in jobcentres who are on modest incomes and are having to see restraint in their pay in these very tough times. That is the right policy. However, the consequences have been that many out-of-work benefit recipients have seen higher cash-yes, cash-increases in their benefits payments over the past three years than many Jobcentre Plus personal advisers have seen in their salaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/6">These are difficult but necessary decisions. We must remember the tough circumstances that many people in work have faced and continue to face across the country as we deal with the effects of the economic crisis. As I have said, we believe that this Bill is necessary to set out a clear and credible plan to make savings from welfare, help reduce the deficit and restore economic recovery. We are taking the tough decisions because it is necessary to give confidence to the markets. Adding to the Bill conditions such as those proposed by my noble friend Lord Kirkwood would diminish the confidence that we require.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/7">I now turn to Amendment 12, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin. This amendment would place a duty on the Secretary of State to instruct the Social Security Advisory Committee to commence a review of the level of uprating if inflation reaches 3.2% in any of the relevant periods as defined in the amendment. I hope that during this and previous debates both I and my noble friend Lady Stowell have been able to convey to the House that we understand and share noble Lords' concerns about measuring the impacts of the Bill and all our reforms on individuals. However, as the noble Baroness slightly suggested in her speech, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/8">Noble Lords will be aware that we already have comprehensive arrangements in place to report on the impacts of government policy. First, we have already published a full account of the impacts of this Bill based on the forecast set out by the OBR. Again, these forecasts are broadly shared by the other main economic forecasters. Noble Lords will be aware that we have also published the child poverty impacts of the Bill. The Government already have a suite of ongoing reporting mechanisms in place and report on the levels of poverty every year in the households below average income series. It is only by looking at poverty issues in the round that we can have a meaningful debate about poverty. Noble Lords will be aware that the Government are currently analysing responses to their consultation on new measures of child poverty, measures that will attempt to capture the wider reality of poverty in the UK today.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/9">Later this year we shall see the first of what will become an annual report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, which will report on the Government's progress towards reducing child poverty, in particular meeting the targets in the Act and implementing the most recent UK strategy. This commission, chaired by Alan Milburn, will report to Parliament and will enable detailed scrutiny of the Government's work to eradicate child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/10">Finally, the Government regularly produce an analysis of the cumulative impact of changes on households across the income distribution. This information is published by the Treasury at every Budget and other major fiscal events. This analysis will use updated inflation projections. We believe that it is a better approach than that in the amendment as it looks at the cumulative impacts of all changes rather than artificially isolating just one policy. The publication of cumulative impacts is a coalition initiative and was not produced by the previous Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.1/11">The Government have taken unprecedented steps to increase transparency and enable effective scrutiny of policy-making by publishing detailed distributional analysis of the impacts of their reforms on households. Our published distributional analysis goes further than that of any previous Government. Having these mechanisms in place means that we are confident that the Government will be able to scrutinise the effects of this Bill and of our whole suite of welfare reforms. I therefore ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.553.0/1">I think it is me, in fact, but let that pass. I am grateful to my noble friend. He and I had a good private discussion about this. I understand the Government's position and he understands my position as well. I plead not guilty to his charge of being clever. All I am trying to do here is to get an insurance policy to protect people who are on benefits who may well need it. I hope I am wrong. He knows more about inflation than I do, but there is a real risk that in the demeanour of the coalition Government's policy, which I would support, to try to attract higher levels of growth, it may be a price worth paying-not to let inflation rip, as my noble friend said, but to allow it to rise reasonably in expectation that growth would follow as a result of that. The shift in the policy changes that.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.0/2">When the Bill was drafted we were in a different position. We are now-we will see tomorrow whether that is correct or not-in a position of the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, for growth, much of which I support. I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that I pay attention to what he says as Britain is a poorer place. These are huge sums of money and we need to work out collectively how we make provision for social protection in future. However, I say to my noble friend-I am looking him straight in the eye-that I cannot accept that this is a safe position to leave the House in. I want the protection-</p>

	<p pid="a.553.1/1">Is not the key point here that the Government have to be able to convey credibility to those around the world who may lend us money? The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has made the point very well. We have to borrow a lot of money or there will be nothing like the present level of benefits if we find, as the Minister has made clear, that we are out on the market trying to borrow from countries and lenders who say, &quot;I thought they had a clear plan. Now they're qualifying it, they may not follow through&quot;. I make this simple point. The noble Lord quite rightly talks about the risk of inflation rising. The risk that he is prepared to accept is that we lose our rating and then we will be in a very much worse state.</p>

If the Government end up with a windfall of &#163;1 billion or &#163;2 billion over and above the saving that I am supporting here, that is completely unconscionable. I am moving this amendment only to try to get an element of inflation protection for benefit claimants. I am grateful to everybody who has taken part in the debate, even the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. I am sorry to do this to my noble friend, but I want to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.557.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100808" speakername="Baroness Young of Hornsey" colon=":" colnum="557"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_139">
	<p pid="a.557.3/1">My Lords, I am pleased to open this second debate on ethics and sustainability in fashion, especially as there is a full-page account of a round-table discussion on the subject in today's <I>Guardian</I>. I am particularly grateful to colleagues on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ethics and Sustainability in Fashion for their hard work and to the Centre for Sustainable Fashion for providing a secretariat alongside MADE-BY. Special thanks go to Dilys Williams, the head of the CSF, for bringing me up to date on key developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/2">Fashion is about so much more than the clothes we wear. It may be an expression of our professional and personal identities, an expression of where and how we see ourselves in relation to our peer group, our cultures, our families and communities, and an expression of our creativity and our sense of fun. However consciously or otherwise we do it, as we dress, so we make a statement, even if the statement is, &quot;I don't care or think about what I wear&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/3">In spite of its importance in so many people's lives, the perception persists that fashion is frivolous and inherently ephemeral. However, better than most, the Minister will be aware of the size of the UK fashion industry and of its contribution to the economy. The estimated amount spent on clothing in the UK in 2011 was &#163;43.9 billion. Despite the high level of garment manufacture carried out overseas, the estimated value of UK-manufactured clothing and textiles in the UK was &#163;8.1 billion in 2011, and the overall estimated export value of UK clothing and textiles was &#163;7.3 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/4">If we take the volume of clothing sales and look at the global nature of the supply chain, and then start to unpack what that means in terms of the relationship between the environment and consumption, a worrying picture emerges. The Waste and Resources Action Programme, known as WRAP, reported in <I>Valuing Our Clothes</I> that we have stashed away in our wardrobes some &#163;30 billion-worth of clothes, unused for at least a year. About a third of the clothing we no longer need ends up in landfill-that is, around 350,000 tonnes or an estimated &#163;140 million-worth of used clothes. On average, the global water footprint of a UK household's clothing exceeds 200,000 litres a year-enough to fill more than 1,000 bathtubs to capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/5">We have to work much harder and be more creative and inventive about how we tackle these problems. Not enough of us make connections between &quot;fast fashion&quot; and climate change, environmental degradation, labour issues in developing countries and resource scarcity. This is not to suggest that nothing is being done. On the contrary, parts of the fashion sector supply chain and increasingly aware consumers, campaigners and legislators have embraced a range of measures, instruments and strategies to mitigate the damage caused by our current practices and processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/6">Last month, I was in Copenhagen, where I gave a presentation to Danish MPs on the APPG on Ethics and Sustainability in Fashion, which I chair. Jonas Eder-Hansen, the director of NICE, the Nordic countries' umbrella group promoting sustainable fashion, and Michael Schragger of the Sustainable Fashion Academy work with Ministers and MPs from Sweden and Denmark, as well as representatives from the industry, to develop and deliver sustainable business models and other strategies to take us forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/7">Here in the UK, the work of Defra and WRAP in promoting the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan, known as SCAP, is seen as a model of good practice and held in high esteem internationally. Indeed, WRAP and Defra were presented with the Global Leadership Award in Sustainable Apparel by the Swedish Sustainable Fashion Academy in Stockholm last month. At the event, I found a strong appetite for collaborating internationally with politicians and the sector. All of us are aware that in our contemporary, globalised world, pollution and unsavoury labour practices are no respecters of national boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/8">Industrial dyes are a case in point. For a start, fabrics are dipped or washed in dyes that are made using copious amounts of precious water. In spite of regulations intended to ensure that the excess, dye-laden water is treated before being disposed of, it is cheaper to dump the dye effluent than to clean and reuse it. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I>'s report on an instance of severe pollution in China where a river literally ran red makes chilling reading. Of course, by not treating water, costs are kept low, as demanded by large retailers wanting to sell cheap clothes to their customers in the USA and Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/9">Consumers need to make the links between their desire for cheap clothing and the loss of livelihoods through depleted, polluted fishing stocks and ever diminishing food and water resources. Add to that the fact that more than 400 people have died in fires in Bangladesh and Pakistan in the past six months, with at least one of the factories involved producing garments for a British retailer, and we have to acknowledge that our current mode of &quot;enjoying&quot; fast, cheap fashion makes no sense whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/10">Fashion today is both global and local, and even much of the produce of many of our high-profile &quot;heritage&quot; British brands, such as Burberry, Aquascutum and Crombie, is often all or mostly made outside the UK. The global nature of the fashion industry means that it is imperative that we work with colleagues internationally to secure more effective international standards on, for example, sophisticated factory inspection measures, labelling countries of origin and instituting traceability mechanisms and so on. Thanks to the horsemeat scandal, the general public is becoming acquainted with the unforeseen complications brought about by globalised processing and trading practices. The longer and more dispersed the supply chain, the more difficult it is to ensure transparency and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/11">One equivalent to the horsemeat issue, if I may put it that way, in clothing terms is cotton. There are many people who would not wish to wear garments made from cotton harvested by children forced to work in the cotton fields of Uzbekistan instead of attending school-I should declare an interest here as a patron of Anti-Slavery International, which has worked ceaselessly to try to persuade Governments and the EU to work harder to stop this practice-but it is impossible to know the source of your shirt, skirt or trousers. Yet some of our largest fashion retailers will not undertake to demand that the companies in their supply chain stop using cotton gathered by state-sponsored forced labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/12">Businesses and consumers alike can be powerful agents of change, and it is clear that education and awareness-raising have a crucial role to play. However, there is also a need for leadership from government in hosting platforms for initiatives, supporting change-makers and investigating the risks of not thinking through the consequences for environmental sustainability. This leadership role should also be concerned with working in partnership to educate consumers and skill up young people on manufacturing and other skills, as well as investing in sustainable fashion SMEs and other projects focused on a sustainable future still infused with excitement, individuality and style.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/13">We have all the incentives we need to act and to act quickly, and we have the individuals and organisations with the talent, so what more can government and politicians do to enhance the effectiveness and reach of these people? Clear, vocal leadership is important, and government Ministers and their officials can fulfil a useful role in supporting initiatives across the spectrum of departments with a stake in finding solutions to the problems we have created. The Sustainable Clothing Action Plan is a good example of government leadership, with an NGO and industry working together to find solutions to complex problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/14">I cannot mention all the different departments that could have some sort of purchase on this issue. Some time ago, DfID, for example, introduced the Responsible and Accountable Garment Sector Challenge Fund. Fashion, of course, lies within the DCMS's remit. It is also within the BIS agenda because of the manufacturing element and also because of the potential of the Green Investment Bank. In fact, in November last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable promised government support to breathe new life into UK textile manufacturing as a study revealed that the cost gap with Asia is narrowing. Can the Minister tell the House how far such plans have gone and the extent to which sustainability and ethics in fashion is a priority consideration? Other departments, such as the MoD or the Department of Health, can support sustainable clothing via the purchase of uniforms and so on through ethical procurement procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/15">Will the Minister undertake to set up a meeting with me and other Members of both Houses on the APPG to discuss how we can best help to support the development of this part of the fashion sector? We need to get a commitment to develop practical, effective strategies across the different departments for realising the potential of rethinking how we &quot;do&quot; fashion. Because of its experience with the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan, Defra is perfectly placed to broker and animate the necessary discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/16">To end on a positive note, technological innovation is crucial. I look forward to the day when waterless production techniques, air-purifying textiles, as being developed by Professor Helen Storey and Professor Kate Storey, and closed-loop technologies, in which the garment is manufactured, sold and eventually reformed so it can go back into the manufacturing process, will be the norm. Then we will know we are getting somewhere. However, we should also acknowledge that there is no single magic potion that can cure our environmental excesses. We need multiple strategies and to work collaboratively and internationally to effect sustainable change.</p>
	<p pid="a.557.3/17">At the British Fashion Council's Esthetica Showcase at London Fashion Week last month, a young designer showed the collection with which she won a competition for fashion designers. The material she had to work with was the discarded clothing and waste materials of Veolia, whose employees collect our rubbish and sweep our roads. It just goes to show that with support, creativity, vision, skill and invention, even the fluorescent strips from a refuse collector's jacket can be turned into a garment of true beauty.</p>

	<p pid="a.560.0/1">I remind noble Lords that this is a time-limited debate and, if my maths is right, we have no spare capacity. When the Clock shows four, noble Lords have had their four minutes.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.560.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100821" speakername="Lord Young of Norwood Green" colon=":" colnum="560"  time="019:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_141">
	<p pid="a.560.1/1">My Lords, with that fresh in my mind I will endeavour to proceed without hesitation, repetition or deviation, as they say. If every Member in the Chamber could examine the labels in their clothing, it would reveal the global nature of high-street supply chains. I am not suggesting we do it as it might cause embarrassment for some. However, I checked my jacket-not that I pretend to be anything to do with fashion-and I noticed that it came from Morocco.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.1/2">I want to focus on the ethical aspect of this debate. I declare an interest as the vice-chair of the Ethical Trading Initiative, a groundbreaking alliance of companies, trade unions and NGOs. The company members include a large number of high street fashion retailers, supermarkets and department stores, with a combined turnover of &#163;166 billion. The trade unions represent 160 million workers around the world and a wide range of NGOs, large and small, is involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.1/3">Every member is committed to the implementation of the ETI base code, which is founded on the ILO conventions. In brief, they state: employment is to be freely chosen, with no forced, bonded or involuntary prison labour; there should be freedom of association with the right to collective bargaining; working conditions should be safe and hygienic; child labour should not be used; living wages should be paid; working hours should not be excessive; there should be no discrimination; regular employment should be provided; and no harsh or inhumane treatment should be allowed. As you can see from the list, all the companies that are members of the Ethical Trading Initiative are on a journey in trying to ensure that workers throughout their supply chain benefit from these conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.1/4">If noble Lords think about some of the stories in the news, only too often unfortunately, such as workers being exploited and denied basic rights, and incidences of child labour, which have been uncovered in many of the supply chains of our high street companies, it shows how difficult it is to ensure that workers get a fair deal. These are workers whose lives are put at risk, as we saw recently in clothing factories in Bangladesh, where fire exits were locked. It shows what a long way we have to go. All of us in the Ethical Trading Initiative have embarked on a huge task in trying to open the minds of companies and consumers to the fact that clothes do not just arrive through a UK-based manufacturing process.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.1/5">Many ETI brands and retailers which sell garments to UK consumers are engaged in activities that attempt to integrate respect for human rights and labour rights throughout their global supply chains. Working with sourcing states and civil society, UK retailers are at forefront of focusing on the UN guiding principles on human rights. On that point, I know that the UK Government support the UN business and human rights agenda and that we are awaiting a document on the human rights and democracy programme from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which is co-ordinating the policies of 12 government departments. I wish it luck in this. Can the Minister tell us when the document is likely to be published?</p>

	<p pid="a.561.0/1">My Lords, on entering this House in 2010 I wore fur-free &quot;non-ermine ermine&quot;. However, I am not just passionate about cruelty-free fashion, so I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for securing this debate and for chairing with such pizzazz the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ethics and Sustainability in Fashion, of which I am proud to be an officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/2">Sustainability, green, eco, organic and ethical are increasingly a part of the fashion conversation. That is to be welcomed although I am not sure everyone has the same view of sustainable fashion. Is it a timeless, classic handbag I can pass on to my daughter-the opposite of the cheap, disposal fashion epitomised by Primark? Is it a dress made from locally sourced materials, with limited transport and a light carbon footprint, or is it a Fairtrade cotton t-shirt produced in a factory where the needs of employees are taken into account?</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/3">The London College of Fashion defines &quot;sustainable&quot; as,</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/4" class="indent">&quot;harnessing resources ethically and responsibly without destroying social and ecological balance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/5">I like that definition; it does not go so far as to pin it down but allows the creativity of individuals to flourish as they interpret what it could mean for their business. As the impacts of climate change hit harder, with resource constraints and more severe weather, we need the clothing industry to develop the necessary resilience to satisfy the colossal appetite for clothing sustainably. The commitments from the Business Secretary in support of the UK textile manufacturing industry are very welcome but more needs to be done to future-proof the industry and to support sustainable and ethical fashion.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/6">Sadly, 20 years after the first child labour and labour standards scandals in our high street fashion chains, we still face the same problems. Clearly, current audit approaches are failing. They rely too much on cheap, bribable inspectors. It is analogous with food supply chain issues, reflecting huge pressures to reduce costs combined with an &quot;unlikely to be found out so don't worry&quot; mentality. Some companies are trying hard to address these issues. One is BBC Worldwide, which refuses to rely on third-party certification and makes its own unannounced checks of its suppliers, has credible and enforced sanctions and promotes its speak-up line to managers and workers in supplying factories.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/7">However, spot checks alone will not address all issues. The fires in a number of Bangladesh factories just before Christmas highlight a problem of ethical culture. During the audits the fire doors were open but when the fires happened they were locked. We need companies such as the GoodCorporation, which argues powerfully to encourage debate about ethics and culture in factories, to move away from blame, to push managers and to take more responsibility for standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/8">We also need more opportunities to showcase best practice, such as the Estethica at London Fashion Week and the RSPCA's Good Business Awards, which have supported the development of animal-friendly clothing policies. Can the Minister say what plans the Government have to address this and to help give companies advice and support as they develop the standards to take on the ethical and sustainability issues, and to provide more platforms to share best practice?</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/9">We need also to focus on clothing, from creation right through to disposal. With around &#163;140 million-worth of used clothing going to landfill each year, we urgently need to address the issue of reuse, exchange and disposal of clothes. I was therefore very pleased to see that the Government's consultation on waste prevention, launched last week, identifies clothing as one of the priority areas for action. We have come a long way with compassionate fashion, largely thanks to powerful campaigning by organisations such as PETA. Opinion polls show that 95% of Britons would never wear real fur and top designers including Vivienne Westwood, Ralph Lauren and Stella McCartney leave fur out of their designs. Even on the high street, icons such as Topshop, H&amp;M and New Look are fur and exotic-free.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.0/10">Green is not the new black; it is not just another trend to come in and go out with the seasons. I applaud the work of the all-party group with partners in industry and government to develop a new space for fashion which respects the need for social and ecological balance and can help create more British jobs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.563.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100489" speakername="Lord Patten" colon=":" colnum="563"  time="019:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_143">
	<p pid="a.563.0/1">My Lords, the more alert of your Lordships may notice that I seem to be the only member of the Tory party Back-Bench fashionista tendency rising this evening. I do that for a number of reasons. One is that I admire what the British fashion industry produces. The noble Baroness referred to that in her introductory speech, and I will not repeat it. I also admire very much the creativity of the British fashion industry. About a month ago, I was very glad to be at my first ever London Fashion Week show, the Matthew Williamson show. I sat in rapt attention on the edge of the seat: indeed, the seats seem to have been designed to ensure that you sat in rapt attention during the whole show watching the models sashay past. It is no wonder to me that the British fashion industry is growing and is contributing so much. Certainly, it is one of the top 20 productive sectors in this country, which has to be a very good thing. The imagination of the British fashion industry is also good. We can see a Matthew Williamson or a Stella McCartney dress being paired with something from Primark or Topshop. That has gone all over the globe, which is much to the credit of those involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.0/2">However, I agree that the ethical issues must be addressed, and I have four points that I wish to make. My first point is the only one which I believe is unique to the fashion industry; namely, that the fashion industry has done a bit, but not enough, to discourage the image of the thin, verging on anorexic, and therefore ill, model in its shows and photographs and the casting agencies which cast these models. Occasionally, there is a bit of breast-beating about it, but I do not think that there is a continuing programme to discourage 13 and 14 year-old girls and boys who want to be models one day. Its message should be to eat responsibly, just as the drink industry should tell people to drink responsibly. I urge the noble Baroness, with her influence in the fashion industry, to press this hard.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.0/3">My second point is that I do not think there is anything peculiar or unique to the fashion industry in the need to manage the supply chain properly and responsibly. It is not just in fashion that we see these problems; it is in the use of children in other parts of the world in manufacturing carpets and toys, as well as in the use of young people who are not very well paid in putting chips into hand-held telephones. A responsible corporation monitors the supply chain and makes sure that it treats those who work in it properly. Much more needs to be done by good corporations in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.0/4">Thirdly, a very good tool is to hand in the condign punishments available under the UK's Bribery Act and bribery legislation. UK companies which permit their supply chains to bribe and act in a corrupt way are those which do not treat their workforces very well. We should ensure that the Bribery Act provisions are implemented the whole way down the line. That would add to health and safety, and to better pay and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.0/5">Fourthly and lastly, ethical and good companies are very appealing to customers, investors and the young of all sorts who go into the shops to buy those goods. Good corporations have the very highest ethical standards. The Prime Minister's presently absentee guru, Steve Hilton-I believe that he is now in the west of the United States-used to run Good Business. It was founded on the highest ethical standards. I look forward to welcoming Steve Hilton back when he comes to re-guru for the Prime Minister next year.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.564.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100798" speakername="Baroness Prosser" colon=":" colnum="564"  time="019:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_144">
	<p pid="a.564.0/1">My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, for securing this debate. As has been mentioned, the all-party group has a very wide agenda. Included under the heading of ethics is, of course, the treatment of people engaged in the production, transportation and sale of textiles and clothing. Shortage of time requires me to concentrate my remarks on just one of those areas, and I will focus on those engaged in production.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.0/2">Let me start with raw materials, in particular, cotton. One of the most disturbing and difficult examples is that of cotton picking in Uzbekistan, which has already been flagged up by the noble Baroness, Lady Young. Uzbek cotton accounts for 10% of the world's harvest, ranking third in the world. It is, of course, a very important product for the country, making up 20% of its GDP and approximately 40% of its hard currency export earnings. The legacy of Uzbek's history with the old USSR, with its continued command economy, does not provide a happy situation either for the farmers or the cotton pickers.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.0/3">A production quota system is forced upon farmers and that, together with the government-set price, means that farmers cannot cover their expenses. Lack of profit leaves no money for investment in machinery, which leads to a continuing heavy reliance on cheap labour. Incidences of minimal payment or no pay at all means that many adults go elsewhere to find work, often to neighbouring countries. The Uzbek Government then step in with a system of forced labour, mostly, but not entirely, made up of children. Some schools in the cotton-growing areas are forced to close between September and November for the picking season so that children, some as young as 10 years old, can be sent to the fields to pick cotton for seven days a week. Children in rural areas are required to carry out weeding of the cotton fields during May and June. The children who pick the cotton have a quota to reach which varies, depending on the local circumstances, between 60 pounds and 110 pounds of raw cotton per day.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.0/4">This is by any other name slave labour and it is not confined to children. The Government of Uzbekistan also forcibly mobilise teachers, public servants and employees of private businesses to harvest the annual crop manually. Failure to comply can mean the loss of employment and/or pension rights. The Cotton Campaign has a list of demands for Governments and companies, and, of course, cotton traders, calling on them to use due diligence in their supply chains, to demand respect for human rights and to require Uzbekistan to abide by the employment conventions of the ILO, to which it is a signatory. In 2008, the country ratified the ILO convention on the minimum working age and the ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.0/5">I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the House that the UK Government will use their best endeavours at the ILO annual conference to bring this issue to the attention of the global community. Uzbekistan cotton is, of course, not the only area of concern to those campaigning for better rights for workers in the textile and clothing supply chain. Labour Behind the Label, an NGO which campaigns for better terms and conditions for those employed in making our textiles and clothing, calls for improvements in wages and in health and safety. It has joined forces with Asia Floor Wage in calling for a living wage across the region and has now widened its embrace to include work with activists in the USA, North America and Europe, but western companies must be more vigilant of the supply chain and take personal responsibility for checking the veracity of locally made claims that all is well.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.565.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100618" speakername="Lord Stone of Blackheath" colon=":" colnum="565"  time="019:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_145">
	<p pid="a.565.0/1">My Lords, perhaps because of our society's destructive obsession with speed and short-termism, fashion is often neither ethical nor sustainable. In many fields we fail to consider the long-term effects of what we do: in politics, it is the next term's votes; in the media, it is weekly ratings; in business, it is tomorrow's share prices; and in fashion, consumers want today's new look. At Marks &amp; Spencer, I was taught by the late Lord Seiff about good human relations in industry. We were not only concerned with the long-term satisfaction of our customers and of our shareholders who were often with us for life, we were also frugal with our use of resources. We used minimal packaging; we did not have fancy window displays; we used low-energy lighting; and even our relationship with our suppliers was that of a long-term partnership. We mainly bought our goods in the UK, but even when we moved some production abroad, we ensured that there was fair pay and good conditions in the factories that made our clothing. Home production is an issue to which I will return.</p>
	<p pid="a.565.0/2">The consumer, too, has a role in this. How does he or she decide what to buy? A brilliant mind in this field, as was mentioned, is the designer, artist and academic, Professor Helen Storey at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion at the London College of Fashion. She is involved in a project that seeks to explore and understand more deeply the relationship between us and our desire to acquire. At the heart of the question posed by this debate lies our understanding of human actions in relation to material consumption habits. Here in the western world we are consuming and wasting at a rate that threatens our own health and that of the planet. The fashion industry exemplifies the complexity and extreme nature of human society's obsessive cycle of creation and destruction, but it is also a great place to find solutions. Fashion sits at a point that crosses economics, aesthetics, psychology, creativity and our individual notions of who we are. This research will produce some really interesting results.</p>
	<p pid="a.565.0/3">At this point I must declare an interest. I have three wonderful children. I tried to stop each of them following me into the shmatter business. Daniel and Jessica work respectively in charities and healing, but I failed with my youngest child, Susie Stone, who has a couture fashion business. She says that sustainable fashion requires us to buy less but wear it more and to spend more on good, bespoke, UK-made clothing, which in the long term will cost you less, suit you more and make you feel better about yourself.</p>
	<p pid="a.565.0/4">On a grander, wider scale, the noble Lord, Lord Alliance, is working on a project to bring textiles back to Britain. He and his team have involved Manchester University, local businesses and regional and central government. This should be supported by regional investment and government grants. Tens of thousands of jobs could be created, so the investment would be cost effective. Within it, ethics and sustainability should be built into contracts to make them synonymous with &quot;Made in Britain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.565.0/5">A friend who has a new factory in the UK tells me that some awful UK factories bring in people at night to work the machines. They are paid by the illegal &quot;cabbage&quot; system. They have no right-to-work documentation to prove they are legitimate workers. We need this stopped so that ethical trading companies with audited compliance are not put at a disadvantage. As well as criticising other countries, we need to enforce ethical trading here in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.565.0/6">Finally, I am afraid we have uneducated consumers in this field. They do not know what is involved in making clothes well from start to finish in terms of skills nor what the costs of a retailer are in terms of staffing, distribution and running stores. The public have never been exposed to this understanding. Many companies in the retail industry tick the boxes in terms of ethical and sustainable initiatives but do not have them high on their agenda because their one-year operating plans are dominated by recession survival and the complexities of multichannel retailing. As we found this week with controlling the press and media, we cannot wait for retailers and manufacturers to put in place voluntary, sustainable and ethical reporting practices. We need to create laws and ensure compliance with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.565.0/7">After the unchecked industrialism of the 20th century and in order to advance sustainable and ethical fashion, there is a need for reinvestment in the textile industry in this country, for transparency and information from brands so that people can make informed longer-term purchasing choices and for legislation and compliance monitoring from Her Majesty's Government.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.566.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100524" speakername="Lord Razzall" colon=":" colnum="566"  time="020:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_146">
	<p pid="a.566.0/1">My Lords, it is not possible to overestimate the importance of fashion design in this country. From Stella McCartney to Vivienne Westwood, we are clearly world market leaders. It is also important that we should highlight the importance of ethical fashion, which was brilliantly highlighted in this House by the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, and outside it by Livia Firth, who is better known in this field than her famous actor husband.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.0/2">We all remember the horrors of Primark, which were referred to earlier. It was accused of exploiting third-world employees to produce dresses that it was cheaper to wear once, throw away and replace with another than to dry clean. However, the big companies have begun to catch on. I commend to the noble Lord, Lord Young, and others-I do not know why I picked on him-the Gucci ecologically 100% traceable bag. It is not black but a burgundy brownish red because this is the best vegetable-sourced colour. The leather is sourced from cows reared without causing deforestation and the handle is made from bamboo that grows like a weed. Gucci may sell furs, but this bag is a start.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.0/3">It is not only major companies that have caught on. The United Kingdom has Brora, which sources ethically produced fibre from the Mongolian goat and turns it into cashmere in Scotland. It also has People Tree, which started in 2001 and is recognised as a pioneer in fair trade and environmentally sustainable fashion. It both provides desirable fashion and works to improve the lives and environment of workers and farmers in developing countries. UK manufacturers do not just provide jobs. Barbour not only makes all its waxed coats in United Kingdom but is a major donor to charity. It has given away &#163;8 million in recent years, including a recent grant of &#163;1 million to Newcastle University for medical research.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.0/4">What can the Government do? That is the Question put by the noble Baroness. I am not a great believer in government intervention, but if we accept that demand for high-end value manufactured goods made here rather than in China is good for the United Kingdom, the Government could, first, encourage universities to concentrate courses on manufacture rather than just design; secondly, following the reference to Vince Cable, contemplate the creation of manufacturing hubs, or &quot;catapults&quot; to use the jargon, to encourage manufacturing; and, thirdly, in their export drives, promote manufacturers and suppliers of ethically produced clothing that is made here. They could also, as the noble Lord, Lord Stone, indicated, give a lot of money to the initiative of my noble friend Lord Alliance.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.567.0/1">My Lords, fashion is a huge global industry, as other noble Lords said, with a large carbon footprint. It has left behind it a trail of eco-destruction. Now, fortunately, efforts are being made to counter the existing structures of the industry. As usual it is the Scandinavians and not us who are in the lead, as they always are on environmental issues. I commend to noble Lords the work of the Nordic Fashion Association, which was briefly touched on in other speeches. It has a very wide range of projects and amazing coverage in the Scandinavian press. One of the main emphases of the NFA is eco-design: integrating sustainability into garments at the design stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.0/2">Among high-profile figures in the UK, I commend in particular Vivienne Westwood for her work on climate change. A couple of years ago I went to speak at a literary festival in Hanover. I gave my speech on climate change. It was followed by the Handel opera &quot;Semele&quot;, performed in the same long, elegant gallery where Handel first presented it. This was &quot;Semele&quot; with a difference. It was called &quot;The Semele Walk&quot; and featured models parading in Vivienne Westwood costumes. All the singers in the opera were also dressed in Vivienne Westwood clothing. It was a brilliant adaptation. She chose &quot;Semele&quot; because it is about the battles of the gods, and climate change is about our battles with the immense forces that we have created.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.0/3">Sustainability is becoming important in the fashion industry around the world. There are many initiatives in North America. The annual Eco Fashion Week debate has been going for six years and attracts 2,000 people from the industry. Even more important is China, where the picture is very mixed. In some respects this echoes what my noble friend said about another part of the world close by. The turnover of the garment industry in China is about $60 billion a year. Most of the money is earned from exports, mainly to the West. There are massive contradictions here. On the one hand, children work all hours to produce cheap garments for the western market. The film &quot;China Blue&quot; is a very good exposition of this. On the other hand, sustainable fashion is now talked of as widely in Hong Kong and Shanghai as it is in London. I admire the designs of Ma Ke, who makes beautiful, traditional clothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.0/4">There are two questions that I would like to ask the Minister arising from this. First, all this is worthwhile but it seems to be nibbling at the edges of the global garment trade and it could degenerate into eco-chic concentrated at the high end of the industry. Is it possible to generalise it to the industry as a whole? Secondly, how do we get the big corporations more involved? As far as I can see, there are many corporations involved, but mainly their corporate responsibility department, which is usually a minor part of the business. We surely need companies to be much more integrated in the whole design process to transform it, and I would welcome the Minister's comments on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.568.0/1">My Lords, I join everyone else in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for securing the debate-it is indeed very timely, in view of the article in the <I>Guardian</I> today-and for her excellent and comprehensive overview of the issues. I am glad that the debate is to be answered by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, for many reasons, not least, and I hope he will not mind my saying this, because we could all agree that he is unarguably one of the most stylish Members of your Lordships' House.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.0/2">I had not intended to speak-I should be singing-but I wanted to make a couple of short points. However, they have all been made by other speakers and so I will quickly pick up on a couple of matters that other people have spoken to and expand them a little. My noble friend Lord Stone spoke about buying less and wearing it more. That is absolutely at the heart of how we change human behaviour in this area. It will be difficult because in the developed world we have become addicted to over-consumption, and fashion is no exception. I am a complete serial offender in this respect. I have that wardrobe full of misguided purchases, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Young, referred, which were bought in haste and without due consideration. I am very ashamed of it, but unfortunately that does not stop me doing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.0/3">We buy too much of everything because we can and because the market is geared towards high volume and low costs, as we have heard from many other speakers. We have largely forgotten how to value, restore, maintain and sustain the clothes that we wear. We are shamefully and shamelessly profligate.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.0/4">This is a difficult issue for Governments of all complexions because the prevailing economic orthodoxy says that consumption equals growth, and growth is the only game in town. I can see that we have got problems but we should surely be wondering whether that model is itself sustainable. I rather doubt that it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.0/5">Fashion, of course, is very much about novelty and therefore inevitably about consumption. However, at its best it is also about beauty, craft, skill and durability, and it is often about small businesses doing one thing really well. Does the Minister agree that one of things the Government can do is to put as much support as they can behind small businesses in fashion, as well as trying to persuade the large businesses to change their practices, which I do not deny is extremely important?</p>
	<p pid="a.568.0/6">We must not forget that sustainable fashion is, of course, about sustainability, but it is mainly about fashion. If we do not get the fashion part right-that is, if the fashion that comes as sustainable is not as good as, if not better than, other fashion choices we could make-then it will never get off the ground. That is why we need small businesses that have creativity built into them.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.0/7">My final point goes to the heart of how we can keep those small businesses coming: our education system. The system that we have at present, as we have already heard, has allowed some very talented people to come through and has allowed the fashion industry in this country to be world beating in many respects. If we do not keep the education system balanced so that the creative education necessary to allow those talents to emerge is properly sustained and valued, we shall find in a few years' time that we are not the world beaters that we once were. I would extend that into the higher education sector where, as I should probably have said at the start, I have a personal interest in the excellent work of the Centre for Sustainable Fashion, which has been mentioned many times today, because my son works for it. What he has learnt through being part of that team has engaged my interest and I hope that there will be more units like the Centre for Sustainable Fashion in future, and that they will themselves be sustained.</p>

	<p pid="a.569.0/1">My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for initiating the debate and echo the thanks for her enthusiastic leadership and for the fashion inspiration that she has given to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ethics and Sustainability in Fashion, of which I am also a member. I declare an interest as a board member of WRAP, which, among other things, as we have heard, manages the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan on behalf of the English, Scottish and Welsh Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.0/2">This is undoubtedly a complex area in which it is difficult to be an active and responsible consumer. In the short time that I have available, I will highlight a couple of ways in which government can make a difference at a UK level.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.0/3">First, it remains surprising that the Government pay so little attention to the fashion sector, as it is a major player in our economy. As the recent WRAP report, <I>Valuing our clothes</I>, identifies, clothing accounts for around 5% of the UK's annual retail expenditure, with consumers spending &#163;44 billion a year on buying clothes, or around &#163;1,700 per household.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.0/4">Many UK clothing producers, particularly small businesses, as my noble friend Lady McIntosh identified, are putting ethical and sustainable fashion at the heart of their business models. They are making a point of celebrating quality manufacturing, greater longevity, respected craft skills and locally sourced materials. However, to expand further they need greater investment in production skills, improved training and a higher status, which would encourage the next generation to believe that the sector has a future. Will the Minister update the House on the steps being taken by BIS and other departments to build up our UK textile capacity and attract the brightest and best young people into UK sustainable textile production and design for the future?</p>
	<p pid="a.569.0/5">Secondly, a wholesale shift towards sustainable and ethical fashion means that all the major production and retail businesses in the sector have to commit to change. I am very proud of the work being done by WRAP in the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan to sign up a list of companies prepared to work towards ambitious targets on sustainability by 2020. Already, major retailers such as John Lewis, Primark and Marks &amp; Spencer are involved. Together they are addressing a range of environmental challenges such as the overuse of scarce water in production, the fact that a third of discarded clothing goes straight to landfill and the short lifespan of most clothing with resulting demands, as we have heard, for endless new purchases to fill the wardrobe.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.0/6">The Sustainable Clothing Action Plan is providing businesses with practical tools to deliver change, such as how to accurately measure the environmental footprint of the clothes they produce, how to design clothes with a longer active life, how to give consumers consistent information so that they can see the benefit of changing their behaviour and how sustainable business models can bring financial benefits as well. For example, it has worked out the financial advantages of retailers providing repair services for their own garments, extending clothing hire services, offering a buy-back and resale section within their stores and providing clothing exchange events among consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.0/7">I echo the congratulations of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, to WRAP and Defra on being awarded the Global Leadership Award in Sustainable Apparel in Sweden in January. Will the Minister confirm that this work continues to be a priority for Defra and that WRAP's work will continue to be funded? Will he reassure the House that, contrary to rumours, environmental sustainability will remain a key priority in Defra's current review of its priorities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.571.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100836" speakername="Lord De Mauley" colon=":" colnum="571"  time="020:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_150">
	<p pid="a.571.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for initiating this debate on the promotion of ethical and sustainable fashion. I have enjoyed the contributions of all noble Lords and I will try to respond in a moment to relevant comments raised during the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/2">Although I make no claim to be a fashion expert, I should declare a vicarious interest by virtue of having a wife who runs a small but, she tells me, successful business retailing fashion accessories. Her range includes, I am relieved to say, sustainable products, notably some in the shape of handbags made from recycled offcuts of leather. She tells me that they are highly desirable. Of course, I am very interested in the range of economic, ethical and environmental issues associated with the fashion industry, which have been so well covered this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/3">As several noble Lords have said, fashion is a vital part not only of our national but of the global economy. In 2009, the United Kingdom fashion industry was estimated to contribute more than &#163;20 billion to our economy and to support more than 800,000 jobs, so this is indeed an industry worth talking about. About 90% of the clothing consumed in the UK is imported. Our consumption has positive economic effects in developing countries, but there are also a wide range of environmental and ethical implications to take into account. We need to consider the water, fertiliser and pesticides used when fibres are grown and the emissions generated when synthetic fibres are made. There are issues associated with access to markets and trade terms for producer farmers. There are concerns about labour conditions in clothing factories, sweatshop conditions and child labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/4">As the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, said, there are significant water as well as greenhouse gas impacts associated with washing and drying clothes and waste at end of life. As the noble Lord, Lord Young, said, we landfill around a third of a million tonnes of clothing every year. There are complex global supply chains. Although the issues are different, the recent and ongoing horsemeat saga has shown that we need to be able to trust all our supply chains, including, of course, the fashion ones. I will return to this in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/5">We want to ensure that the fashion sector continues to grow. Several noble Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, in particular, spoke about small businesses, and I agree with her. I will return to that point in a moment. Last October, the Government hosted the UK fashion and textile manufacturing showcase. This was part of the Government's Make it in Great Britain initiative, designed to dispel the myth that the UK does not make anything any more. UK Trade &amp; Investment is promoting UK products and services to customers abroad and encouraging foreign investment in the UK through its GREAT campaign. I hope the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, will be pleased to hear that Creative Skillset, the sector skills council for the creative industries, recently launched its first higher level apprenticeship in fashion and textiles and is planning to deliver 500 apprenticeships. My noble friend Lord Razzall and the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, both spoke about higher education, and I will return to that, too, time permitting.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/6">As for environmental improvements, my department, with WRAP, co-ordinated the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan, which several noble Lords referred to. This is a collaborative effort with businesses and third sector organisations to reduce the environmental impacts of the UK clothing supply chain. The organisations involved include high-street names such as Nike, Sainsbury's, M&amp;S, John Lewis and Primark, as well as clothing reuse and recycling organisations such as Oxfam and the Salvation Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/7">This is a world-leading initiative, which has been recognised internationally. As the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said, Defra and WRAP have just received the 2013 global leadership award in sustainable apparel from the Sustainable Fashion Academy in Stockholm. I am proud about that and pleased that the noble Baroness was able to be there.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/8">Government action to improve ethical standards in the fashion sector includes the creation of the Responsible and Accountable Garments Sector-RAGS-Challenge Fund. This fund helps projects that improve the conditions of vulnerable garment production workers. It is aimed at workers in low-income countries in Asia that supply the UK market.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/9">DfID has also provided support to the Ethical Trading Initiative, an alliance that brings together businesses, trade unions and voluntary organisations and has developed a base code to define the minimum standards that member companies should reach. The nine provisions of the base code include that child labour shall not be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/10">The Government, of course, need to look to their own procurement, too. The government buying standard for textiles was published in December 2010. It limits the levels of hazardous chemicals and encourages the consideration of durability, the use of recycled fibres, ethical standards and end of life disposal. We are now starting a review of this standard and plan to strengthen it and cover additional issues such as demand management, recyling and repair, and we will work with the Government Procurement Service to embed the new standard in the framework contracts for use across government. We are working hard to ensure that the climate is right for growth in the UK fashion industry, and at the same time are encouraging businesses to move UK consumption on to a more ethical and sustainable footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/11">I will now address questions the noble Lords have asked. The noble Lord, Lord Young, referred to the number of government departments involved. Ethical and sustainable fashion is a complicated topic, and there are roles here for more than one government department. DCMS leads on the UK fashion industry, BIS on UK business, Defra on environmental policy aspects, and DfID on poverty reduction aspects. We work together to ensure that appropriate links are made without duplicating or generating unnecessary bureaucracy. There are cross linkages between the initiatives. For example, Fairtrade, the ethical trading initiative, and DfID are all members of the sustainable clothing action plan steering group. Many of the businesses involved in the Ethical Trading Initiative are also involved in sustainable clothing action plan, and there is a joint BIS-DfID trade unit. In many cases it makes sense to take a wider geographical approach. We look at the broad range of issues in a particular country and identify opportunities for reducing poverty and improving working conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/12">The noble Baronesses, Lady Young and Lady Prosser, raised the issue of child labour in Uzbekistan in particular, I think. In negotiations about eligibility for the EU's generalised system of preferences, we understand that there are legitimate concerns about the use of forced labour during the cotton harvest season in Uzbekistan. There remains much to do, but we welcome this year's progress; enforcing a ban outlawing the use of children aged under 15 in this year's cotton harvest is a step in the right direction. We continue to monitor the situation and encourage further efforts towards full implementation of Uzbekistan's obligation under the ILO conventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/13">My noble friend Lord Patten asked about child labour, and other noble Lords have also referred to this matter. The Government are committed to ensuring that children are not engaged in work that is harmful or detrimental to them. We know that this is an ethical issue-perhaps the issue on which, as the noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, said, UK businesses already take action. I also agree with my noble friend Lord Razzall, who has congratulated several businesses that he has named. We help by supporting organisations that enable companies to demonstrate their commitment. I have referred already to several initiatives. Let me add to the Ethical Trading Initiative and Fairtrade the UN Global Compact, which is a call to companies everywhere to align their operations and strategies with 10 universally accepted principles, including abolishing child labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/14">We are working towards long-lasting changes that tackle the poverty we identify as being at the root of the problem of child labour. The noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, referred to the launch of the UK business and human rights strategy. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has led a successful process across government to agree the UK's first strategy on business and human rights. Arrangements are being finalised for the launch in the near future. The UK has played a leading role in supporting the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/15">My noble friend Lady Parminter asked about government advice to UK business on ethical issues relating to specific countries. I have already mentioned the strategy on business and human rights. This includes clear signposting to advice provided by different government departments responding to business feedback during extensive consultations when business requested clearer guidance on how to approach the Government for advice. The Government also provide guidance to businesses on how to carry out corporate social responsibility reporting on environmental and ethical issues. I think it is fair to say that UK companies lead the world on corporate and social responsibility reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/16">My noble friend also asked about audit and checks on the supply chains. Textile supply chains can be complicated, with many intermediaries, and UK businesses often do not have visibility along their whole supply chains or even beyond their tier 1 suppliers. That said, many businesses are working to improve this, and even without full transparency they can still influence the practices of their suppliers through their product specifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/17">The noble Lord, Lord Stone, spoke about the role of consumers. I agree with him. Further action that consumers can take include buying pre-owned clothing, choosing fair trade products, washing at lower temperatures and recycling textiles. He also asked whether the Government would introduce compulsory reporting on corporate social responsibility for all UK companies, particularly in this area. UK companies, as I have said already, lead the world in choosing to report on their contribution to social, ethical and environmental sustainability. We support mechanisms that help them to improve their reporting and are keeping a watching brief on current trends towards more mandatory reporting in some countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/18">My noble friend Lord Razzall raised the issue of encouraging universities to support ethical fashion. London is seen as a global centre of fashion, with our universities attracting students from around the world. In 2011, almost 18,000 students were registered on fashion and textile courses, and there were 190 apprenticeship starts in the fashion and textile framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.0/19">I will write to noble Lords if I have not answered all their questions. To finish, there is no simple answer to the many economic, environmental and ethical issues associated with the global fashion industry. However, I hope noble Lords will agree that we are taking action and are making progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.574.4/1">My Lords, I rise to move Amendment 6, which is in my name and that of my noble friend Lord McKenzie as well as the names of other noble Lords. We rehearsed this issue in Committee but I return to it on Report because, with apologies, I found the response from the Minister so disappointing. Because it is the last amendment of the day, I will be brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.574.4/2">The Government estimate that some 232,000 families will claim statutory maternity pay, or SMP, in 2012-13, rising to 235,000 in 2013-14. Using the Government's own inflation forecasts, the Children's Society calculated that if a woman were on maternity leave now with her first child, and had her second child in 2015, she would find that she received about &#163;184 less in real terms during her second period of maternity leave than her first. If her earnings were below the flat-rate level of SMP, that figure rises to &#163;217. Just when a family needs money most, support is being cut.</p>
	<p pid="a.574.4/3">This is by no means the first assault on the living standards of mothers of young children. In Committee, I recited the litany of cuts to support for parents of new children. I will spare the House the entire list but will just reprise one or two. We have seen the abolition of the health and pregnancy grant, the abolition of the Sure Start maternity grant for all but the first child, the abolition of the baby element of child tax credit and the cancellation of the planned toddler element, the abolition of the government contribution to child trust funds, cuts to the percentage of childcare help and much more. Since then, the Children's Society has analysed in detail the impact of those changes. The results are shocking. They have calculated that a working couple about to have a second child in 2015 could find themselves over &#163;7,000 worse off than they would have been over the following two years, simply as a result of changes since 2010. That is the context for this amendment and, indeed, for this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.574.4/4">My second concern is that the Minister failed entirely in Committee to address the question that I raised as to the rationale for including SMP in this Bill. Noble Lords may recall that the Prime Minister's official spokesperson responded to critics by telling the <I>Telegraph</I> that it was a &quot;personal choice&quot; for parents to decide whether to return to work or to stay at home after having a child. Of course it is, just like deciding where to go on holiday, where to shop, or where to buy your children's clothes is a personal choice-if you have enough money, that is. If not, then it is George at Asda for you, rather than Giorgio Armani Junior. Money is what makes people have choices, not simply the fact of having a baby.</p>
	<p pid="a.574.4/5">However, that was not the reason that the Chancellor gave when he announced this Bill back in the autumn. He claimed that the legislation was necessary to ensure that the welfare state was fair to working people, and not to those who lie in bed with their blinds down when their neighbours go to work. In Committee, I asked the Minister to explain how SMP fits with his argument. Let us recall that SMP is a contributory benefit, paid only to women who have given up work to give birth or to care for a new baby, after having been in continuous employment for the requisite period and earning enough to require their employers to pay national insurance contributions on their behalf. However, answer came there none. I therefore ask the Minister one last time: how does including SMP in this Bill fit with the Chancellor's narrative, and why should pregnant women and new mothers pay the price for a tax cut for millionaires? I look forward to the answer. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.576.0/1">My Lords, I very much support what my noble friend has said in moving the amendment. The House seems very quiet this evening, following the shenanigans of this afternoon when it looked very much to some of us as thought there was an organised group on the other side-many of whose members are no longer present, of course, it being after dinner time-who found a huge interest in this Bill in order to keep the Report stage going. Be that as it may, those times are obviously passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.576.0/2">If I read correctly, the Minister-to whom I attach no blame at all for what has been going on, of course-said in reply to my noble friend in Committee that the cost in the last of the three years of allowing this amendment would be around &#163;50 million. Let me tell her one way, at least, that that &#163;50 million could be found five times over. The communities department has &#163;250 million to spend, and has done for some time, in order to make rubbish collections weekly rather than fortnightly. No doubt that is a priority for some, and no doubt it has a validity of its own. However, compared to the wrong which is being done by this Bill-and by others too-and in particular the wrong addressed by my noble friend in her amendment, could the Government not get some proper sense of priority as to what does and does not matter, even at this late stage? That is &#163;50 million, compared with &#163;250 million that is sorted away. This was not mentioned, of course, by the noble Lords who were this afternoon defending the Government's position with such vigour, because it is an inconvenient truth that in Government there is spend which could be much better spent on protecting those who are going to be hammered by this legislation. I ask the noble Baroness to answer my question: what is wrong with spending part of that &#163;250 million, and agreeing to my noble friend's amendment?</p>

	<p pid="a.576.1/1">My Lords, I was not intending to speak on this amendment, but I rise at the prodding of the noble Lord, Lord Bach, who seemed to suggest that some kind of operation was going on in the conduct of our discussion. If there was any operation, the strangest thing about it was that there was not a single speech from the Back Benches of Her Majesty's Opposition. It is amazing. We are talking here about what we recognise as being critical issues. On each amendment, there were probably three speeches from the Back Benches here, but not one single speech from the Back Bench of the Official Opposition. If the noble Lord wants to come back on that, I shall be more than happy to give way.</p>

	<p pid="a.576.2/1">I overheard one of the government Whips encouraging those who sit on the Privy Council Bench to speak and speak and to string out it out to delay the votes. I heard that myself. Those Members made their own decisions and I do not in any sense criticise the quality of their speeches. I also saw briefing being passed from the Minister and so on. Perhaps the noble Lord could not see from where he was sitting in the same way as we who have a front-stalls view of what is going on might have done, but, certainly, there was active encouragement of three privy counsellors, none of whom has been known to display any interest in social security hitherto-unlike the noble Lord. All credit to the noble Lord: he has stayed with us; he works on these matters; and he tries to take a balanced approach. I make no criticism of him, but, as to today's proceedings, there was not a shadow of doubt. Perhaps the noble Lord was sitting in the wrong place, in more ways than one.</p>

	<p pid="a.577.0/1">That is a wonderful way of expressing it. The noble Baroness has been complimentary to me; let me reciprocate by stating a fact. She knows more about this subject than anybody else in this Chamber and everybody would immediately acknowledge that. Our previous discussions in Committee and at Second Reading were enhanced immeasurably by her thought-provoking contributions. Now, what is more unusual: that a few Members on Her Majesty's Government's side should rise to speak in support of the amendments or that the noble Baroness did not make one speech during their consideration?</p>

	<p pid="a.577.1/1">I am grateful to the noble Lord for letting me come back on this. Today, we started with a key debate on whether it was right to tie future Secretaries of State's decisions on the rate of uprating of benefits. My noble friend Lord McKenzie moved the relevant amendment and we had an extensive discussion. We then had a hugely important debate on children, a hugely important debate on disabled people and then an important debate led by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, will know as well as I do that, as we had only effectively half a day-because people are not here after dinner-to discuss four key issues, either we had to postpone key debates to a period of time when no one would be here, including his Privy Council colleagues, to listen and take part, or we acted in a way that was self-disciplined in order that the arguments at least in their basic form could be heard, so that those who wished to-and there were not very many on his side-could come in and listen to those points being made to see whether they affected their vote. We were trying to act responsibly. Had we had two days on Report, we could have paced it differently and I for one would have been delighted to have spoken at least three times on each amendment and made a dozen speeches.</p>

	<p pid="a.577.2/1">I take the noble Baroness's point and shall not pursue it further. I had not intended to make that point, but it is important. Perhaps I may say one other thing. Since I have trodden on a few toes, let me tread on truly sacred ground.</p>

	<p pid="a.577.3/1">I wonder whether the noble Lord is going to deal with the amendment in what he has to say.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.577.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100976" speakername="Lord Bates" colon=":" colnum="577"  time="020:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_160">
	<p pid="a.577.4/1">I am going to deal with it. I want to come back to the point that I was going to make previously, because I think it is relevant. For the first six weeks of the 39 weeks of statutory maternity pay, 90% of the benefit that is payable is linked to earnings. The point that I was going to make is that, while benefits have increased in line with inflation by 20% in the past five years, as we have heard many times, average earnings have increased by only 10%. In fact, according to the Centre for Social Justice, that increase for some of the lowest earners, particularly females, has been 7.8%. I wanted to make the point that in terms of helping with maternity pay at that particular point, the best we can do is see a growth in salaries. If salaries grow, it is axiomatic that the statutory maternity benefit in that first six weeks will be enhanced. The problem is that salaries have been suppressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.577.4/2">The OBR report relating to the Bill that we are debating shows some quite encouraging signs. For the first quarter of 2014, we have a forecast of increases in the order of 4.5% per year, growing to 4.6% during the period of this Bill. Surely increases of that nature, when linked to the statutory maternity pay of which we are talking, must have some effect. In the same way, I inquired of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, who introduced this amendment, whether the stark numbers that she presented to us contained any element that reflected the suppression of wages that we have seen over the past five years. This has been seen particularly in the private sector, although it has been in the public sector as well, where wage increases are subject to a 1% cap. That is the point that I ask the noble Baroness to clarify when she responds.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.578.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100307" speakername="Baroness Howe of Idlicote" colon=":" colnum="578"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_161">
	<p pid="a.578.0/1">My Lords, it is good to get back to the subject of the Bill. I support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock. Although everyone is inevitably suffering under this economic disaster, it is surely completely counterproductive for the Government not to make specific arrangements for those who produce and support children. This is a particularly important generation of children. We will all need to depend upon them and will need to help them develop to their full potential if we are to have a brighter and more economically successful future. Not to do so will also specifically disadvantage-I would argue even discriminate against-women.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.0/2">Whatever hopes there are for both parents to share childcare in future, to include statutory maternity pay at present would clearly disadvantage women, on whom the main responsibility remains for their children's upbringing. It will also particularly disadvantage single parents, the vast majority of whom are women. While 30% of all households with children are affected, 95% of lone parents-that is 2 million-are affected by the Bill. The Government have already estimated that the Bill will push a further 200,000 children into poverty, so what effect will this economic deprivation have on this vitally important next generation of children and their well-being?</p>
	<p pid="a.578.0/3">First, there is their health: the 2010 Marmot review highlighted how poor health is strongly linked to low socioeconomic status. Children in the lowest-income households, for example, are three times as likely to suffer mental health problems as their more affluent peers. At the age of 33 they are at increased risk of severe long-term and life-limiting illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.0/4">Next is their education. The link between economic disadvantage and educational underachievement is widely recognised by academics, as well as by parliamentarians. Children's cognitive development, related to parental social status, is evident as early as 22 months. The earliest high-achievers from deprived backgrounds are overtaken at five years, with this gap widening by the time children reach 10. DfE figures also show that only 26.6% of secondary school pupils eligible for free school meals achieved five or more A* to C GCSEs, compared with 54.2% for all the rest.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.0/5">In employment, inevitably, the educational and health inequalities drive a similar divide. Young people who are NEET are more likely to have grown up in socially disadvantaged households, for example, from single-parent households and those where parents also have low educational qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.0/6">Finally, there are family relationships and children's subjective well-being. Living on a low income is stressful and difficult and can, and often does, adversely affect family life and intra-familial relationships, as well as children's assessment of and satisfaction with their lives. Poverty can make strong parent-child relationships more difficult, and research shows that children growing up in poverty are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem and to be socially isolated.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.0/7">Having listened to the excellent speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, and a range of other subjects also brought into the conversation, I hope that the Government will find a way to accept this very reasonable amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.579.0/1">My Lords, I must say to noble Lords on the Benches opposite that we have had a number of debates about the economic context in which we are making these changes, and I have been disappointed that more noble Lords have not found themselves moved to contribute to them so far. I am glad that there have been more contributions to this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.579.1/1">My Lords, I thought that we had discussed this already. Can the noble Baroness help me by describing how we could have made our contributions? As she knows, four or five of us have regularly taken part in social security debates-including my noble friends Lady Lister and Lady Donaghy, and me, among others. If we had made our contributions, does she think that we would have got to the important debates on disability and the 3% trigger amendment before dinner? If not, does she think that it would have been fair to disabled people to exclude them from the possibility of Parliament reconsidering a foolish decision?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2013-03-19a.579.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101091" speakername="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" colon=":" colnum="579"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#st_164">
	<p pid="a.579.2/1">In my short time in this House, we tend to sit until about 10 pm and have debates on amendments at all times that we are sitting. I did not realise that we were expected to have debates before a certain time at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/2">Let us focus on statutory maternity pay. I remind the House that the UK has a strong and effective maternity and parental regime. The UK is significantly more generous than the requirements of the EU pregnant workers directive. The directive states that a woman should benefit from 14 weeks paid maternity leave; we provide 39 weeks. The directive states that a woman should receive at least the amount that would be paid for sickness; our standard rate of maternity pay and maternity allowance is &#163;135.45 per week. That compares to the statutory sick pay rate of &#163;85.85 per week. In addition, the latest available data from the OECD show that the proportion of our GDP spent on maternity and parental pay is higher than that in Germany or France.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/3">It is also worth reflecting on the fact that in the past decade, the length of time for which statutory maternity pay was payable more than doubled. Under the previous Government, it was doubled. It is important to be aware of the baseline that we are starting from.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/4">Yes, the decisions that we have to take on statutory maternity pay will mean a slightly smaller increase for people over the next few years, but that is in the context of a strong and effective maternity architecture in our country which will remain firmly in place. Indeed, the Government are committed to make this architecture even stronger. Noble Lords will soon be debating provisions in the Children and Families Bill which allow working parents to choose which parent takes parental leave and parental pay to care for their child in the early years.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/5">It is also important to understand these changes in the context of other government reforms that support women, families and children and help make positive changes to their lives. I said this in Committee, but it is important, so I will repeat it. For example, a woman working full time at the national minimum wage for six months of the tax year who then receives statutory maternity pay for the next six months will still be better off overall as a result of changes to the income tax personal allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/6">We have debated universal credit many times before, and it is acknowledged that its purpose is to make it worth while for people to move back into work. Once universal credit is introduced, some 800,000 out-of-work lone parents would benefit significantly if they started to work just 10 hours per week. In nearly all such cases, these parents would see at least &#163;40 more in their pocket per week than they would have done under the current system. Also as part of universal credit, &#163;200 million extra is being spent to support families with childcare costs. For the first time, this support will be made available for families who work fewer than 16 hours per week. That means 100,000 more working families will be helped with their childcare costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/7">Looking ahead, as my noble friend Lord Newby mentioned in one of the earlier debates today, we have set out changes that will increase eligibility of support to five times as many families as currently is the case through a new tax-free childcare scheme. As part of these changes, we have also announced today a further &#163;200 million additional support in universal credit that will provide working families with the equivalent of 85% of their childcare costs where the lone parent or both parents pay income tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/8">When referring to various different payments to families, the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, said that she could go on; so could I. There are other things that the Government are doing to support families and women. The support for families that the Government provide is about more than income transfers. I do not deny that families value them and they can make an important difference, but money is often better invested in interventions that really can change lives. In demonstrating this today, I have tried to explain what the Government are doing in addition to the comprehensive support that we provide to new mothers and to show how much there is in providing for families in the right way.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/9">This amendment would reduce savings from the Bill by around &#163;50 million in 2015-16. As I have said, we have taken none of the decisions in this Bill lightly, but we have to recognise that if the savings do not come from the measures set out in the Bill, that could clearly put additional pressures on to public services. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, mentioned alternatives that he would like to propose. They are not ones that I would point to because these amendments are part of a Bill that is about reducing by a smaller amount the increase that we pay in benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/10">To answer the noble Baroness's question about why we are including statutory maternity pay, we have sought to address the very significant welfare bill, which I am afraid is unsustainable, but doing so in way to protect the most vulnerable. We discussed and debated that at length earlier today. Regrettable as it is to have to make any reductions or cap any of the increases in the way that we have, the infrastructure and architecture there for women and families are strong. They provide sound support that will make a real change to people's lives. While I recognise that these are difficult decisions, I hope that I have provided enough assurance to the House to show that the Government take their obligations to parents seriously and that we will continue to provide a supportive environment for new mothers in the years to come. I hope therefore that the noble Baroness can withdraw her amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.581.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate, especially to my noble friend Lord Bach for his strong support, and to my noble friend Lady Hollis for her interventions. I am also grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for a thoughtful and persuasive speech that highlighted the impact of these cuts on the next generation. I thank her for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/2">In response to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, I would say three things. First, we have debated this a lot. We sat through the previous stages, and we have all contributed in long form to the Committee stage and reflected a great deal on this. I hope that we now know what each other think. Certain noble Lords contributed to every amendment but they did not make five speeches; they made the same speech five times. I am not sure that that took us much further. None the less, we are doing our best here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/3">I say to the noble Lord that it is worth noting that the poorest mothers get the flat rate of SMP and are therefore unaffected by any impact on wage growth, so that point would not affect them. On the question of wage suppression, the consequence of that-in fact, of the whole Bill-is a double whammy for those who are finding that their wages are frozen or have been kept down, because these benefits and tax credits are the very things that will normally help to compensate the individuals as well as acting as stabilisers more broadly.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/4">With regard to the Minister's comments, I appreciate that she had been dealt a difficult hand and I do not envy her having to play it. She has given us a description of the baseline from which we are starting. The real baseline for this Bill is &#163;15 billion of cuts to support for families by 2015-that is the point that we are starting from.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/5">The Minister mentioned that there were all these benefits for parents. I was particularly confused by her citing the fact that lone parents could be better off if they work for 10 hours a week. We are talking about women on maternity leave. These are women who are already working but have given up work to have a baby. Although it may be interesting for other lone parents to work for 10 hours a week, that is hardly an answer to the impact of the Bill on people who are having babies.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/6">The Bill is basically an assault on the living standards of people who are struggling to make ends meet at the moment, and I have heard nothing from the Minister today to make me feel any less concerned about the impact that it will have on mothers-to-be and women who have just had babies. However, given that it has been a long day and given the lateness of the hour, disappointed though I am once again in the Minister's answer, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/7" class="italic">Amendment 6 withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.0/8" class="italic">Amendments 7 to 15 not moved.</p>
