    <p pid="a1438.2/1">My Lords, the ongoing emergency of sewage despoliation and the death of our rivers and coastlines is something the Government do not seem to be acting on at all. Last year, on <phrase class="date" code="2023-09-08">8 September</phrase>, the then Secretary of State for the Environment—I cannot even remember which one it was—told water companies to produce a plan within 14 days. It is 165 days later and there is no plan. I gather water companies have been told again. When are the Government going to deal with this ongoing emergency?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2023-02-20a.1501.0" speakername="Baroness Scott of Bybrook" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25468" colnum="1501" time="19:00:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1501.0/1">My Lords, this group of amendments includes those related to new missions and metrics. The missions contained in the levelling-up White Paper are the products of extensive analysis and engagement; this analysis is set out in the White Paper. As I have made clear already, the Bill is designed to establish the framework for missions, not the content of missions themselves. The framework provides ample opportunity to scrutinise the substance of those missions against a range of government policies.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/2">I start by addressing Amendments 4 and 9, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Lister of Burtersett and Lady Hayman of Ullock, which would require the levelling-up missions to include a mission on child poverty. Let me say that everybody in this Government accepts that child poverty is an issue that needs continually to be kept an eye on, managed and acted upon. However, the way we deal with it is perhaps the issue that we need to discuss. We believe that the best and most sustainable way of tackling child poverty is to ensure parents have opportunities to move and progress in the workplace. Setting targets can drive action that focuses primarily on moving the incomes of those just in poverty to above a somewhat arbitrary poverty line, while doing nothing to help those on the very lowest incomes or to improve children’s future prospects. We therefore have no plans to reintroduce an approach to tackling child poverty that focuses primarily on income-based targets. Ministers and officials engage extensively across government to ensure a co-ordinated approach to tackling poverty, and we will continue to do so in the future.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/3">Moving into work is the best way to improve lives. In 2019-2020, children in workless households were over six times more likely to be in absolute poverty than those in households where all adults were in work. Since 2010, there are nearly 1 million fewer workless households; under the Conservatives, 1.7 million more children are living in a home where at least one person is working. However, that is not to be complacent. The issue for me—the noble Lord, Lord Best, brought it up—is good housing, good education, good skills and good jobs. All these things are covered by the missions, and they do not need to be one separate mission.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/4">While I am talking about living standards, my noble friend Lord Young asked about the definition of living standards. The Bill seeks to raise the living standards of people in work and people who are able to work, or whom we can get into work:</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/5" class="indent">“By 2030, pay, employment and productivity will have risen in every area of the UK,”</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/6">getting those who are not already in work into work. That is the definition in the White Paper.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/7">The levelling-up White Paper highlights the challenges faced by children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and how these vary between and within places. It takes a systematic approach, through the missions, to address a number of factors which we believe contribute to child poverty. The levelling-up mission on living standards commits to increasing pay and employment in every area of the UK, which would in turn help to reduce child poverty. We are also committed in the White Paper to investing an extra £200 million to expand the Supporting Families programme in England, which will help to improve the life outcomes and resilience of vulnerable children and their families. Additionally, over £300 million in funding for family hubs and Start for Life has been allocated to 55 high-deprivation local authorities, supporting a focus on perinatal mental health and parent-infant relationships, infant feeding and parenting support. These are very important at the beginning of a child’s life, as we heard again from the noble Lord, Lord Bird.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/8">The Government have provided cost of living support worth over £37 billion for 2022-23, including the £400 non-repayable discount to eligible households provided through the Energy Bills Support Scheme, and up to £650 in cost of living payments for around 8 million households on means-tested benefits. From <phrase class="date" code="2023-04-01">1 April</phrase> 2023 the national minimum wage will rise from £9.50 to £10.42 per hour, providing a significant increase to the wages of those on the lowest wages. The reduction to the universal credit taper rate in 2021 also increases the incomes of the most vulnerable.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/9">Through our devolution deal, local government is able to provide support for child poverty reduction at a local level. For example, as part of the North East devolution deal, the North East Combined Authority is committed to continuing and expanding the North of Tyne Child Poverty Prevention Programme—local people working on local priorities.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/10">I will move on to several amendments relating to new missions and the protection of our environment. Amendment 8, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman of Ullock, would require that the levelling-up missions include a mission to tackle climate change and protect our natural environment. Amendments 18 and 19, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Stunell, would mean that all emission outcomes must consider net-zero mitigation and adaption measures, as well as environmental targets set out in the Environment Act. Amendment 28, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Willis of Summertown, would require that the levelling-up missions include a new mission on access to a healthy environment. I also want to address the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor of Stevenage, which would mean that the Government’s reports must include an estimate of the impact of emissions.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/11">I agree with all these amendments. It is vital that we deliver a system that places environmental considerations at the heart of policy-making across government. For this reason, all Ministers of the Crown are required, through the Environment Act 2021, to ensure that environmental principles are considered in policy-making. These principles guide Ministers and policy-makers towards opportunities to prevent environmental damage and enhance the environment. The issues that have been brought up are already in statute and I do not think they need to be repeated.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/12">We are already taking a range of steps to give people more access to the natural environment close to where they live. For example, the levelling-up parks fund will improve access to quality green space in over 100 neighbourhoods across the UK, through the creation or significant refurbishment of green spaces in urban areas that need it most. Work on the England coast path, which will improve access to the coast by linking the best existing coastal paths and creating new ones where there are none, is progressing, with nearly 800 miles now open to the public.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/13">We have also invested significantly in active travel, helping people to connect with nature through cycling and walking. In addition to the £200 million allocated through the active travel fund, an additional £33 million had already been committed this financial year to support local capacity and capability on active travel. I am sure that this issue will come up again, as my noble friend Lord Young of Cookham said, when we talk about spatial planning in a later debate.</p>
    <p pid="a1501.0/14">The levelling-up White Paper has set out our commitment to the green revolution and the transition to net zero through the £26 billion of capital investment. Low-carbon businesses have already created 400,000 jobs and an estimated turnover of more than £41 billion in 2020, which has helped to create a basis for multiple missions. The net-zero review, published by Chris Skidmore, contains several proposals that will help the Government meet their net-zero target by 2050, in addition to driving economic growth and increasing living standards. The noble Lord, Lord Stunell, was correct that we must ensure that the green revolution and its economic benefits move across the whole country and not just certain areas. We are seeing that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2023-02-20a.1507.0" speakername="Baroness Randerson" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25053" colnum="1507" time="19:33:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1507.0/1">My Lords, I put down this regret Motion because the purpose of this SI runs directly contrary to the points of principle that we on these Benches argued for during the passage of the Subsidy Control Bill. We argued for more consultation with devolved Administrations; instead, this SI reduces it.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/2">In explanation, this instrument removes an obligation for the CMA to consult with the devolved Administrations when preparing or revising the policy statement in relation to information-gathering powers, which are used by the Competition and Markets Authority’s Subsidy Advice Unit under the terms of the Subsidy Control Act 2022. It also removes the requirement for the Secretary of State to consult the devolved Administrations when making regulations about penalties in relation to these powers.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/3">The Act established a new subsidy control regime to replace the EU’s well-established state aid. The Government’s aim was to enable local authorities and devolved Administrations to deliver subsidies more tailored to local needs. The CMA, via its SAU, has a monitoring role, and there are penalties for not complying with its information-gathering powers.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/4">The Act touches on a sensitive area of overlap between reserved and devolved powers: subsidy regulation is reserved but economic development is devolved, and, clearly, subsidies are an important economic development policy tool. When the subsidy control powers operated under the EU umbrella, DAs worked to a pretty clear and non-party-political framework of rules. On paper, the Government’s aims in making the new framework more sensitive to local needs should make economic development easier for devolved Administrations and local authorities. However, these regulations undermine the whole principle of sensitivity to local needs by removing the obligation to consult.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/5">There are additional aggravating features to this situation. First is the lack of any previous notification that this was the Government’s intention. I can find no specific announcement during the passage of the Bill that this was how the Government intended to use their power. The Welsh Government inform me that they were first informed on <phrase class="date" code="2023-07-21">21 July</phrase>, when shown a draft of these regulations. At official-level meetings prior to this date, there had apparently been none of the usual courtesies of giving advance information on the Government’s direction of travel, which would have enabled Welsh Government officials to have some input into the drafting.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/6">Secondly, there is the opaque way in which this legislation is drafted. Although these regulations flow from the Subsidy Control Act, they implement an implied amendment to the internal market Act. Noble Lords will recollect that that Act was controversial from a devolution perspective: the DAs did not grant legislative consent, and attempts were made to amend the Bill to take greater account of the economic development responsibilities of devolved Administrations. These regulations mean that the internal market Act remains drafted as is from the textual standpoint but with an implied textual amendment which will have the effect of removing the requirement to consult with devolved Administrations. It will give the Secretary of State more discretion on penalties and give the CMA more discretion on policy relating to subsidy control.  The CMA Subsidy Advice Unit already has no obligation to give due regard to DA opinions, and this is another blow to the possibility of positive relationships between devolved Administrations and the UK Government. This is a pity, as I am told that relationships between the SAU and officials in devolved bodies have been very positive, so there is no good reason to change the balance of powers. As well as removing the obligation to consult, this also removes any possibility of challenge if devolved opinions are ignored. I suspect that this is the Government’s intention here: governing always seems easier if you shut yourself away and do not listen.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/7">These regulations will bring the duties placed upon the SAU out of line with the duties placed on the CMA’s Office for the Internal Market, suggesting that a similar retrenchment of devolved powers may be likely for the latter. Do the Government have such plans?</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/8">Further aggravating features were brought to our attention by the diligent work of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. It expressed concern that the Government’s explanation or defence of the removal of this obligation to consult is that the CMA and the Secretary of State will still have to consult the devolved Administrations if their interests are “sufficiently affected”. The SLSC stated that, in the absence of any definition of this term, it is worried about how it will be interpreted. I hope the Minister can be very explicit on how the new rules will be interpreted.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/9">The SLSC also drew our attention to a serious error in the Explanatory Memorandum, which said that the DAs had not objected, when in fact they had done so unequivocally. The EM has now been corrected, but this is a serious error—much worse than the usual omissions. If the views of the DAs on the regulations governing consultations are misrepresented, it is hard for us to have confidence in the good faith of the consultations that flow from them.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/10">In summary, these regulations will impact adversely on economic development opportunities in the devolved nations and hinder the ability of the DAs to shape the subsidy regime of the future. They reinforce the view that this centralising Government are determined to take every opportunity, however small, to undermine devolution. I realise that the Government want to hold all the reins of power, not least because, in this case, carefully placed subsidies are an easy way to bolster support in chosen parts of the country. The same principle underpinned the Government’s decision to centralise the shared prosperity fund and to cut the Welsh and Scottish Governments out of decision-making. The outcome of the first round of that funding makes my point for me.</p>
    <p pid="a1507.0/11">I urge the Minister to think long term. Every time the Government chip away at devolution, they persuade a few more voters living in the devolved nations to give up on devolution and move to support independence. The Government should instead be bolstering good relations with the devolved Administrations, and that means respecting their powers and opinions. The Government are in danger of making enemies out of friends. The Welsh Government are not the Scottish Government; they are not predisposed to object to  everything. I am sure the Minister will seek to reassure me that consultation with the devolved Administrations will in fact continue, but unfortunately the evidence is already there that it is pretty sketchy and corners are cut on existing obligations. I thank the Minister for his prior interest in my concerns on this, and I assure him that I will listen carefully to his response.</p>
