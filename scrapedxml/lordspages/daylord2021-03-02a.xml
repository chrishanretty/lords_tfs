    <p pid="a1057.8/1">My Lords, we recognise the need to pursue other opportunities for the region in parallel to large nuclear. In December, the UK Government, working with the Welsh Government and local authorities in the region, committed £120 million to the north Wales growth deal, which has the potential to create over 4,000 jobs by 2036 and to deliver an economic uplift of £2.4 billion.</p>

    <p pid="a1057.9/1">With the promise of future UK Government investment in Wales, will  the Government commit to working with the Welsh Government to encourage a major new energy scheme on Ynys Môn, including options for tidal power, with both barrages and free-standing turbines? Further investments in offshore wind and the grid infrastructure  to support it would make north Wales an attractive option for low-carbon electricity generation and bring much-needed economic opportunities for young people in north Wales.</p>

    <p pid="a1058.0/1">The noble Baroness is right to focus on the energy sector for Ynys Môn. The announcement overnight of the £5 million investment in the Holyhead hydrogen hub, adding to the Welsh Government’s investment, £253,000 from the £120 million north Wales growth deal for the Morlais tidal flow schemes and the commitment to invest in the production of one gigawatt of offshore floating wind, in which Wales has a technological head start, all show that we are delivering on our promises for Wales and working with the Welsh Government.</p>

    <p pid="a1058.1/1">My Lords, the Minister believes passionately in the need for nuclear power and, judging by her excitement over the result of the match on Sunday, also about Wales. When I asked on <phrase class="date" code="2021-01-11">11 January</phrase> about how many large nuclear power stations were planned as part of our future energy mix, she replied that the country would need “significant, large nuclear capacity”. First, is she able to specify a number? Unless we act now, we will run out of options and, indeed, power stations. Secondly, if we cannot get a major nuclear power station at Wylfa, possibly the best site for one in the whole of the United Kingdom, is there scope for development of advanced small modular reactors, with the benefit of the production of hydrogen as well as power?</p>

    <p pid="a1058.2/1">We have been ambitious in our plans for new nuclear. We committed to at least one more gigawatt power plant in the energy White Paper published before Christmas and we are in discussions with a number of operators. There will be two operational power stations in 2030 and, by 2032, the first SMR should be operational too. We will look at all reasonable proposals for the development of the Wylfa site, which is, in fact, the best nuclear site in the world, not just the UK.</p>

    <p pid="a1058.3/1">My Lords, the Government has refused to support the construction of a tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, whose suitability will be well known to the Minister. She has referred to the possibility of tidal power in the Anglesey area. Will the Government consider the feasibility of tidal power in the Menai Strait between Liverpool Bay and Caernarfon Bay, a large infrastructure project that would provide jobs for Anglesey and beyond?</p>

    <p pid="a1058.4/1">Indeed, the Government are committed to exploring all the possibilities for tidal and wave power—in south Wales there is not only the Swansea tidal lagoon but the Dragon Energy Island project, and we will certainly look at other proposals in the north of Wales as well.</p>

    <p pid="a1058.5/1">Given the unfortunate news that Horizon Nuclear Power has decided to drop its planning bid for Wylfa Newydd, does my noble  friend agree that a freeport would transform the fortunes of Holyhead and Anglesey, encouraging greater development, investment and tourism on the island, as was outlined clearly to the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Select Committee last year? Is the Minister able to inform the House as to whether any progress has been made on a freeport?</p>

    <p pid="a1059.0/1">The noble Lord, Lord Davies, raises an important point. The freeport bids for England are already in and an announcement is expected shortly. I know that the MP for Ynys Môn, Virginia Crosbie, has worked tirelessly with a group of qualified and interested local stakeholders to put together a bid for a freeport for Ynys Môn. This will be ready to go when we launch the competition for Wales, on which we will work together with the Welsh Government.</p>

    <p pid="a1059.1/1">My Lords, I declare my interests as in the register. The national thermal hydraulics facility is a key part of the nuclear sector deal and will bring jobs and investment to Anglesey, making the most of the strong nuclear skills that exist in the area. Can the Minister say what progress has been made with this facility and, importantly, how it will align with the testing requirements of the UK SMR programme?</p>

    <p pid="a1059.2/1">The national thermal hydraulics facility is a key part of the nuclear sector deal and would indeed bring jobs and investment to Anglesey. The issue is very live at present. Collective and separate discussions are taking place between BEIS, the Welsh Government, the UKAEA, Rolls-Royce, whose SMR design is pivotal in this decision-making process, and the Menai Science Park, which would host the hydraulics centre. The technical needs of the Rolls-Royce SMR are being worked into a redesign of the proposed facility, but issues still remain over the height-planning restrictions, extra funding and future financing requirements of the facility. Perhaps all the parties can dig deep.</p>

    <p pid="a1059.3/1">I heard the referee got man of the match. Is Shearwater Energy, which could be generating power by late 2027, under consideration? The energy White Paper announced £385 million for the advanced nuclear fund to support the development of both SMRs and AMRs, with up to £215 million of investment to develop a domestic SMR design. Does the Minister champion a large sum of this funding to support a small hybrid reactor at Wylfa on Anglesey?</p>

    <p pid="a1059.4/1">The Shearwater design is indeed an imaginative use of Ynys Môn’s unrivalled potential for generating power, both nuclear and in offshore wind; the Shearwater proposal as I understand it combines both, with an interconnector. The Government remain open to discussing well-developed proposals from all developers for the Wylfa site, and I believe the team has had some discussions with officials in BEIS.</p>

    <p pid="a1060.0/1">Will the Minister agree with me that what is happening to Holyhead as a port is a very threatening thing indeed? There was no preparation when we were leaving the European Union and the result is that for documentation, lorries from Holyhead, having come over the Irish Sea, now have to go to either Birmingham or Warrington. Has the Minister any proposal at all that will avoid Holyhead becoming a port of the past, with ferries from Ireland going directly to the European mainland? What hope can the Minister bring to Holyhead?</p>

    <p pid="a1060.1/1">The noble Lord raises an important point in an area of concern. Freight through all Welsh ports is down more than 50%, unlike freight through most UK ports, which have now recovered to pre-Brexit levels. We have no obvious answer as to the question why, as the landbridge between Ireland and Wales remains a vital transport artery, with significant cost and time advantages over maritime routes. The Minister for Wales in the other place has a meeting scheduled with the relevant freight transport association to discuss these issues and what we can do about them.</p>

    <p pid="a1060.2/1">My Lords, I welcome today’s announcement of government backing for the hydrogen hub at Holyhead put forward by Menter Môn and Anglesey Council, and indeed proposed in the Senedd a year ago by Ynys Mon MS Rhun ap Iorwerth. Given the aspiration of Anglesey, seen as the “energy island”, what steps will the Government take in partnership with the Welsh Government to ensure that the Wylfa labour force, with its huge skill base in energy-generation technology, is retained in the local energy sector and is not lost to the region?</p>

    <p pid="a1060.3/1">The noble Lord makes an extremely good point about trying to preserve the corporate knowledge within Wylfa and I will certainly take back this concern and proposal to the department. Wylfa still has the potential to be part of the north-west nuclear arc, along with the national thermal hydraulic research centre, the Trawsfynydd site for SMR, AMR and, potentially, medical radio isotopes, alongside Bangor University, which is a centre of excellence for nuclear studies.</p>

    <p pid="a1060.4/1">My Lords, does the difficulty of finding a company to build a large nuclear power station at Ynys Môn not highlight the lack of nuclear expertise in this country—the first country to actually use nuclear for civil purposes. The one area where we do still have it is building nuclear units for submarines. Perhaps I might add my voice to that of the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, and ask my noble friend to consider a small modular reactor at this site; after all, additional modules can be added later.</p>

    <p pid="a1060.5/1">There are indeed design proposals that involve a number of small modular reactors on that site, and the Government believe that these will play an important role alongside large nuclear for low-carbon energy.

    <p pid="a1061.3/1">My Lords, the Government are committed to providing Transport for London with a financial deal that is sustainable, supports London’s recovery and keeps the capital moving. Any deal must be fair to the UK tax- payer. On <phrase class="date" code="2021-01-11">11 January</phrase>, TfL provided us with a financial sustainability plan, which sets out its plans to achieve financial sustainability by April 2023.

    <p pid="a1061.4/1">My Lords, TfL has suffered a double blow to its income from the pandemic and from years of irresponsible fare setting by the Mayor of London. While my noble friend grapples with that temporary challenge, will she also bear in mind that a railway needs steady capital investment too, and that there are parts of London Underground operating with signalling and rolling stock that is over 50 years old and is creaking at the seams. Will she, in support of the Government’s infrastructure objectives, seek to ensure that TfL is allowed a medium-term investment programme—however modest—to address these problems?</p>

    <p pid="a1061.5/1">My noble friend is quite right: there have been some quite interesting fare increases—or not—from the mayor over recent years. We estimate that over the past four years his fares freeze has cost £640 million, which could otherwise have been spent on capital expenditure. But, as my noble friend knows, transport in London is devolved and it is up to the mayor and TfL to assess the merits of capital projects that they might want to invest in. However, it is absolutely clear that the Mayor of London must set a robust budget, demonstrate that TfL is on a clear path to achieving financial sustainability, and prioritise his capital expenditure. He will have to make difficult choices.</p>

    <p pid="a1061.6/1">My Lords, many of us are old enough to remember renewing our road funds not with the DVLA but with the county council. It was £12 and 10 shillings when I started driving.

    <p pid="a1062.0/1">My noble friend raises a very interesting period of time that unfortunately I do not remember, but it is the case that the Mayor of London has some very interesting ideas as to how he wants vehicle excise duty to be spent. It is one of the proposals in the financial sustainability plan he has prepared, which I have to say does seem to have been drafted with a money-no-object mindset. Noble Lords will know that vehicle excise duty is used for the strategic roads network, which is the motorways and the major A roads, so unless we are going to stop Londoners from using our motorways and buying products that have been brought into London by HGVs travelling on them, I see absolutely no rationale for devolving VED.</p>

    <p pid="a1062.1/1">My Lords, I read in the Financial Times today that the ONS says that as an average Londoner I receive about £4,000 less in public spending than I pay in tax. As a proponent of progressive taxation, I am happy to pay, but the fable of the goose that lays the golden egg comes to mind. Will the Minister agree that the economic prosperity of the whole country depends on a prosperous London, and that that requires, among other things, a well-connected London with excellent public transport? Is it not remarkable that London is the only major city in the world where there is no contribution from general taxation, from which the whole country would benefit?</p>

    <p pid="a1062.2/1">The noble Lord is right that London will play a very important part in the economic future of our nation; in 2018 it made 23% of UK GDP. But while much of the funding for Transport for London comes from passenger revenues, there are other routes by which it gets money; for example, business rates retention, which is a retention which would otherwise have gone to Her Majesty’s Government. So one might assume that there is a broad breadth of sources of funding for TfL, but I agree—the Government want to support London’s recovery and we want to keep the capital moving.</p>

    <p pid="a1062.3/1">My Lords, train operating companies have received billions of pounds from the start of the pandemic to keep trains running, with minimal requirements in return. Why has Transport for London not been treated with the same generosity, and why are the Government determined to dictate the minute details of the way services are run, which they have not done on railways elsewhere? Surely this could not be political.</p>

    <p pid="a1062.4/1">My Lords, TfL has also received billions of pounds over the Covid pandemic. I am not sure where the noble Baroness is getting her information from about the differential between the conditions that are put on the train operating companies and on TfL. The Government make demands  on the train operating companies. We work incredibly closely with them on, for example, what the level of services should be and whether engineering works should take place. We put significant conditions on our support for them. We put some conditions on TfL support, such as looking at the future of driverless trains and increasing efficiency targets. All these things are perfectly reasonable.</p>

    <p pid="a1063.0/1">Instead of levelling up the north, where the Government have cut £4 million from Transport for the North, clearly the Government intend to level down London’s transport network. Virtually every answer that we have heard from the Minister today has confirmed that this is the Government’s approach. Can the Minister confirm or otherwise that the Government are not seeking to force TfL into making cuts to its service level, which would be completely counterproductive and place at risk the economic recovery of central London, which, like it or not, is still the engine of the UK economy?</p>

    <p pid="a1063.1/1">The Government will provide funding to TfL. We have already said that we will and that we want to keep the capital moving. That is essential. We can also agree that the forecast scenarios that are available for passenger demand will, quite frankly, resolve only over a period of time. The Mayor of London is going to have to think about his capital expenditure and service levels in the future. He may have to make difficult decisions, but there are a number of reforms that the Mayor of London should have done but has not done, and probably should do in the future, in addition to potentially looking at service levels.</p>

The Government will expect the mayor to make decisions that encourage the economic growth of London.

My noble friend may have seen that the Government agreed to safeguard the land for the Bakerloo line extension. It cannot be built now but it may be built in the future.</p>

However, I will discuss very briefly the amount of funding that the Government have been able to support for Crossrail. Back in August 2020 the board of Crossrail said that it would need another £1.1 billion, which was probably about the P70 budget. The Government have announced £825 million so that the GLA can borrow further funds to get Crossrail over the line and open to passengers.</p>

It extends to many hundreds of pages, and contains a huge amount of commercial information which we would not want to see in the public domain, as it would not be beneficial to the future of TfL. But the report did give us a firm understanding of where TfL is at the current time. It should be remembered that, even before the pandemic, TfL had a deficit in 2018-19 of £494 million. Combined with that KPMG report and the financial sustainability plan that we have received from TfL, we are in a much better place to help the Mayor of London get TfL back on its feet, and the Government are ready to support that.</p>

    <p pid="a1065.1/1">I am grateful to my noble friend for his Answer. Since my noble friend Lady Cumberlege published her landmark review, another 150 babies have been born suffering harm from in utero exposure to sodium valproate, to add to the 18,000 children—18,000, my Lords—who have been harmed in this way since the 1970s. These children belong to families whose lives have been turned upside down, and who often cannot afford the costs of caring for their damaged children. They need and deserve a redress scheme now. Why can the Government not move faster?</p>

    <p pid="a1065.2/1">My Lords, I pay tribute to those who have put together the valproate registry scheme that became live on <phrase class="date" code="2021-02-11">11 February</phrase>. My noble friend is entirely right. There are 22,095 people on the registry; 462 of them had 490 conceptions, and 180 women were prescribed in a month when they were pregnant. A redress scheme is not necessarily the correct solution to this problem. We are considering it extremely carefully, and when we publish our overall response to the Cumberlege review we will include our considered response to the redress suggestion</p>

    <p pid="a1065.4/1">My Lords, I will leave it to the response to the Cumberlege review to make the decision on the redress scheme. In the meantime, our focus is on a regime ensuring that those who take this important drug have the right advice to prevent them becoming pregnant. I emphasise that specialists review the treatment and ensure that an annual risk acknowledgment form is signed by the prescriber and the patient. This is an important measure ensuring that all those who take this potentially life-changing drug acknowledge and understand the implications of becoming pregnant.</p>

    <p pid="a1065.5/1">My Lords, in our report we suggested that every pregnant woman who is on sodium valproate should be warned by her GP of the potential harm to her unborn child.

    <p pid="a1066.0/1">My Lords, as I explained a moment ago, there is an annual risk acknowledgment form signed by the prescriber and the patient, and that is shared with the patient’s GP. GPs should check that the patient has signed an up-to-date annual risk acknowledgment form each time a repeat prescription is issued. We have instituted a valproate safety implementation group that analyses, along with the MHRA, compliance with this plan. We acknowledge the review’s recommendation to introduce an indicator on safe prescribing in pregnancy for future iterations of the quality outcomes framework, and we will respond on that with the rest of the response to the review.</p>

He speaks very movingly and thoughtfully, and we are greatly influenced by his persuasion on this subject.

    <p pid="a1067.1/1">I have two points. First, last summer only 41% of the respondents taking valproate said that they had signed an annual risk acknowledgment form, so I would like the Minister to reflect on the fact that some GPs are not doing the job that they should be in terms of protecting women. Secondly, those affected by thalidomide and contaminated blood have a redress scheme, but it took years for that to happen. We simply cannot wait years for this to happen for those suffering from the effects of sodium valproate.</p>

    <p pid="a1067.2/1">My Lords, I welcome the noble Baroness’s point on the proportion of those who say they have filled in the form. Phase 1 of the registry is a helpful collection of statistics, but we are putting in place phase 2, which will help us to understand exactly how many patients who are taking sodium valproate have actually filled in the form. That will give us the concrete reassurance that we seek on this matter. I recognise that there are redress payments for thalidomide and contaminated blood, but redress payments are not necessarily suitable for every single misfortune that happens in the medical world. However, we will look very carefully at the case for sodium valproate and I take the noble Baroness’s comments on board.</p>

    <p pid="a1067.5/1">My Lords, the report First Do No Harm underlines the hurt and devastation that can result from not making patients aware of the possible side-effects of drugs. The harm done by giving sodium valproate during pregnancy  cannot be undone, and generous support should be provided.

    <p pid="a1068.0/1">The noble Lord puts it extremely well and I totally agree with the thrust of his point. For patients to have the right information about the risks of the medicines that they are prescribed is essential. However, if I may stray into a different subject, there is also patient choice. For many patients, sodium valproate provides an incredibly valuable relief from epilepsy and mental illness. It is a drug that continues to be prescribed because some have no choice and there is no valid alternative to the drug. The number of people being newly prescribed the drug—new starters—is down dramatically from previous years, but for some it really is an important part of their therapy. The decisions that they make are personal ones, and we should respect those.</p>

Given the number of people we see using food banks in my diocese and around the country—including working people—and the number of children in poverty and likely to go deeper into it, the remedial costs of supporting them into the longer-term future will far outweigh anything paid now.</p>

    <p pid="a1069.4/1">My Lords, an analysis by the Social Metrics Commission found that, without the universal credit uplift, nearly 1.4 million people would have been pushed into poverty due to the pandemic.

The need to reduce health risks, such as by taking taxis to appointments to avoid public transport, purchasing more PPE for those with respiratory conditions and using more heating to reduce the risk of complications from Covid-19 all incur high costs. In previous questions, we have heard that the costs of disability and sickness are considerable, particularly to people who have little at the moment and are on legacy benefits.

I would like to think that we have moved towards reducing the ways in which people can get on universal credit. Obviously, there are many problems for people who want to go on to it, and they are still having to wait a long time. My question is more about the long-term effect of universal credit. How much does it cost to actually deliver £1 of social support, because in the old days it used to be about a fiver to deliver that £1?</p>

    <p pid="a1072.0/1">My Lords, the challenge we have is uncertainty. Genomic sequencing data links the Brazilian variant to the South African variant, the so-called E484K mutation. We also acknowledge that there are anecdotes from Manaus on transmissibility, but none of this is clear cut. We are working towards getting the concrete data necessary to make a confident assessment of this mutation. Therefore, we are taking a precautionary approach and we are committed to limiting its spread by all means at our disposal.</p>

    <p pid="a1072.1/1">I thank the Minister. According to a report by the World Health Organization, the P1 variant that originated in Brazil has been found in at least 15 countries which are not on the Government’s red list, meaning that arrivals from those countries are currently exempt from the hotel quarantine policy. Virologists have warned that the Government’s red list is at risk of becoming out of date at any time because of the time it takes to sequence coronavirus cases. Indeed, these six cases date back to 11 and <phrase class="date" code="2021-02-12">12 February</phrase>. In the light of these facts, and given concerns that the Brazilian variant may be more transmissible and might be resistant to existing vaccines, will the Government review the red list and take urgent action to introduce a comprehensive hotel quarantine system that applies to all UK arrivals?</p>

    <p pid="a1072.2/1">The noble Baroness is entirely right: this is not the first case of P1 in Europe. As of <phrase class="date" code="2021-02-11">11 February</phrase>, P1 has been identified in 17 countries, with 200 cases reported globally. In the EU, 30 cases have been identified in five countries and areas. We keep the red list under permanent review and have an ongoing process of keeping it up to date. The fact that we have a red list and a managed quarantine programme makes further expansion of the red list possible. It puts our borders and our vaccine under a programme where we can control things, which is to be applauded.</p>

    <p pid="a1072.4/1">We are uncertain on the vaccine. There is a huge amount of speculation, but I would recommend that noble Lords take it with a pinch of salt because we cannot know for sure how the virus will behave with those who have been vaccinated until we have much better and clearer data. Regarding the current managed quarantine arrangements, I pay tribute to the teams which have stood up the system extremely quickly and well. The south Gloucestershire and Aberdeen arrangements have been incredibly impressive. It is extremely frustrating to all concerned that one person did not fill in the form and slipped through the net. But overall, the programme has shown itself to be extremely robust and we have an enormous amount of confidence in it.</p>

    <p pid="a1073.0/1">My Lords, we seem to be devoting a huge amount of state resources to chasing one person with a mutating virus at a time when the National Health Service is on the point of collapse. Waiting lists are going up and we are in a terrible mess. Will the Government accept that viruses mutate and that we need a strategy to deal with that? Constantly locking people up and extending the list of countries so that you can put more and more people into hotels is a self-defeating policy.</p>

    <p pid="a1073.1/1">The vaccine is absolutely central to our strategy. It is an approach that has proved enormously popular, and I think I speak for a large number of people when I say that defending the vaccine has to be our number one priority. If there were a highly transmissible vaccine-escaping mutation, it would take us back to the beginning of this whole pandemic. That is why we have put in place red list countries and managed quarantine. That is why we are committed to Operation Eagle and the efforts to track down those bringing variants of concern into this country.</p>

    <p pid="a1073.2/1">My Lords, the scientists are concerned about the P1 Brazilian variant because of three mutations, one of which is common to other variants, making it more transmissible. One of the others is referred to as the “escape mutation”, which may bypass some vaccine-induced immunity. Does the Minister agree that, apart from the measures the Government are taking of trace, track and isolate and surge testing—which I thoroughly approve of—it is important to continue genomic sequencing, at scale, of Covid cases to detect variants that may arise and to monitor and study post-vaccine immune response? That would enable us to modify the vaccines to boost the immune response and deal with the variants.</p>

    <p pid="a1073.3/1">The noble Lord is entirely right. Our commitment to genomic sequencing, which has lasted for years, has put Britain in great shape to be able to do the sequencing necessary to track these variants. We are doing more sequencing than any other country. But as the noble Lord knows, this is detective work, and it is extremely complex. While the 484K mutation might be the significant change in both the Brazil and South African variants, it might be one of a great many other mutations in its genomic characteristics. This is the detective work we are doing. I am afraid that it will take some time to get to the bottom of it, and it needs to be complemented by field studies into how the mutation reacts in real life, as well as with antibodies. The combination of immunology, virology, biology and real-world clinical study will give us the insight that we need.</p>

    <p pid="a1073.4/1">My Lords, with due respect to the Minister, I wonder if a pinch of salt is quite the right treatment for some of these variants of the Covid virus. It is not just the Brazilian and other different variants. For example, in addition to Siqueira’s paper, which has just been published from Brazil in the last couple of weeks, the paper from Bogota shows numerous variants which are not quite the same. Some of these may be rather more virulent, and it is possible  that they may even cause reinfection—it is certainly not very clear. The point is this: surely we need to be very cautious indeed about our airports and whether the list we have is sufficient. At what stage do we decide that we need to take much firmer action with all incoming passengers to the United Kingdom, making certain that they are properly tracked and traced?</p>

    <p pid="a1074.0/1">The noble Lord is entirely right. Things are happening around the world which are causing a great deal of anxiety. Stories of possible reinfection in South Africa are extremely concerning and the huge spike in infections in South America has not been properly explained. It is possible that there are a number of mutations, and mutations of mutations, there. The truth is that we do not have the genomic or immunological data that we need to fully understand what is going on. That is why we have taken a precautionary approach, as the noble Lord recommends. We have instituted both managed quarantine and a red list which we keep under review. If we feel it necessary to extend that list, we will do so.</p>

So why does the £22 billion test and trace system not have an individual identifier on each test posted to homes, along with an integrated database?

The noble Lord will note that the South African variant, which made landfall in the UK, is currently being contained through the immense work of this team. They are throwing a blanket over communities and doing a huge amount of forensic, detective work in tracing variants. As to his specific point, it is possible for someone to walk up to a testing station, take the test, be handed a form and not fill it in.

    <p pid="a1076.0/1">My Lords, at the outset, my noble friend said that the Government wanted to use all means at their disposal to combat the spread of all the variants and mutations. I refer to a point I made last week. One means at the Government’s disposal is to ensure that all those who work in care homes are vaccinated. It is quite wrong that they can refuse it and then attend to the most intimate needs of their patients</p>

    <p pid="a1076.1/1">My Lords, I remind my noble friend that we have some mandatory vaccination already in place in the health service; those who perform operations and other intimate health interventions are required to have hepatitis and other vaccinations, for instance, so there is a precedent for what he talks about. However, it is a huge step, which impacts people’s personal liberty and choices, to make vaccination mandatory for more than a million social care workers. My noble friend makes a persuasive argument, which is why the Cabinet Office is looking at exactly this sort of matter; there is a strong public health argument for mandatory vaccination. Given that we have not rolled out vaccination across the whole population yet, it is premature to make that decision today, but we are considering it carefully.</p>

Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port and Battery Manufacturing Strategy
 - <i>Commons Urgent Question</i></major-heading>

    <p pid="a1076.3/1" class="italic">The following Answer to an Urgent Question was given in the House of Commons on Monday 1 March.</p>
    <p pid="a1076.4/1">“The Government are absolutely committed to ensuring the future of manufacturing at Ellesmere Port and to secure the jobs and livelihoods of the workers at the plant. Since I was appointed Business Secretary last month, I have held a number of meetings with both Vauxhall and its new parent company, Stellantis, to support the company to make a positive investment decision. Only last week, I also held a constructive meeting with the general secretary of Unite, Mr Len McCluskey. Over the coming days and weeks, I, fellow Ministers and officials at BEIS will continue this intensive dialogue with the company.</p>
    <p pid="a1076.4/2">More widely, the Government are continuing their long-standing programme of support to keep the British automotive sector at the forefront of technology and maintain its competitiveness, building on the work that my right honourable friend did through the automotive sector deal.</p>
    <p pid="a1076.4/3">It is my priority as Business Secretary to ensure that the UK continues to enjoy the benefits from our transition to ultra-low and zero-emission vehicles by continuing to build an agile, innovative and cost-competitive supply chain, which we need to secure vital international investment. With that in mind,  we remain dedicated and absolutely committed to securing UK battery manufacturing. As part of the Prime  Minister’s 10-point plan, we have already announced £500 million to support the electrification of vehicles and their supply chains, and other strategically important technologies, through the automotive transformation fund over the next four years. We continue to work with investors through the automotive transformation fund, and to progress plans for manufacturing the batteries that we will need for the next generation of electric vehicles here in the UK.</p>
    <p pid="a1076.4/4">The Government and industry have jointly committed almost £1.5 billion through the Advanced Propulsion Centre and Faraday battery challenge to support the research, development and manufacture of zero and low-emission technologies. Between 2013 and 2020, the Advanced Propulsion Centre has funded 67 collaborative R&amp;D projects, creating and safeguarding nearly 47,000 jobs, with projected CO2 savings of 244 million tonnes.</p>
    <p pid="a1076.4/5">I repeat: we are 100% committed to making sure that the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing, and we are doing all we can to protect and create jobs while securing a competitive future for the sector here in the UK in particular, including at Ellesmere Port.”</p>

    <p pid="a1077.0/1">My Lords, the Ellesmere Port plant is a major employer, and letting it wind down would have devastating consequences, with 1,000 highly skilled jobs lost in the local community. The Government must do all they can to secure the future of the plant, and it is worth reminding ourselves that the automotive sector has had no sectoral support during the pandemic.</p>
    <p pid="a1077.0/2">To achieve net zero and sustain our automotive industry, we need a plan and action and investment. As such, will the Government bring forward ambitious investment in electric vehicle technology, including the electric battery supply chain, in tomorrow’s Budget—so that manufacturers have the long-term confidence that they need to build new electric models in the UK and so that we can move forward and secure the future of Ellesmere Port as a major automotive producer?</p>

    <p pid="a1077.1/1">I assure the noble Lord that we are doing all that we can to ensure that Ellesmere Port has a bright future. The automotive industry in general is an essential part of the Government’s plans for green growth, levelling up across our country and driving emissions to net zero. As the noble Lord will be aware, as part of the Prime Minister’s 10-point plan, the Government brought forward the phase-out date for new petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2030, and, by 2035, all new cars and vans must be fully zero-emission at the tailpipe.</p>

    <p pid="a1077.2/1">My Lords, I am on the executive of the All-Party Parliamentary Motor Group. In his Statement, the Secretary of State boasted that some £1.5 billion of joint funding had gone to the APC and the Faraday battery challenge. To put that into context, that is about a tenth of what the French Government are putting into this sector. The fate of Ellesmere Port will be decided in days, but the Government have had  years to get ready for moments like this. Everyone knew and knows that we need significant battery manufacturing capacity in this country. The Faraday challenge has been running for eight years, so what has stopped a battery gigafactory being built already?</p>

    <p pid="a1078.0/1">Ultimately, of course, these are commercial decisions for the companies involved, but we are working closely with a number of people interested in establishing gigafactories.

    <p pid="a1078.1/1">My Lords, I congratulate the Government on their aim to ban sales of new internal combustion engine cars from 2030. What specific plans do they have to invest in the production of electric vehicles and batteries to ensure that the UK remains competitive globally in manufacturing? Does my noble friend see a role in this for regions such as the north-west, where Vauxhall is sited?</p>

    <p pid="a1078.2/1">I agree with my noble friend that it is very important that we see a future for these industries. As I have said, we are doing all that we can to help—I outlined our financial commitment in my answer to the noble Lord, Lord Fox. I come from the north-east, so I want to see it do well along with the north-west, and I repeat my earlier answer that we are doing all that we can to secure the future of the Ellesmere Port facility.</p>

    <p pid="a1078.3/1">My Lords, like everyone, I welcome the introduction of full electric vehicles, but the Secretary of State said:</p>
    <p pid="a1078.3/2" class="indent">“We want to see a circular economy for electric vehicles.”—[Official Report, Commons, 1/3/21; col 33.]</p>
    <p pid="a1078.3/3">However, he also said, “If we attain that”. Can the Minister give us an assurance that the Government are looking into how this can be achieved? A recent report by the Transport and Environment Committee found that it is eminently feasible to have batteries that are one-fifth lithium and nickel and 65% cobalt, coming from recycled sources, by 2035. Will the Government put some sort of target into legislation as a statement of intent to drive the industry to do just that?</p>

    <p pid="a1078.4/1">I outlined in previous answers the support that we are giving; we are looking closely at all these matters. I am sure that it is eminently possible to ensure that a circular economy applies to electric vehicles as much as it applies to many other parts of the economy.</p>

    <p pid="a1078.5/1">Are the Government aware that electric vehicles can only ever be a tiny part of reducing our carbon emissions—and that it would be more effective to stop building new roads and not open new coal mines? If they are worried about jobs, the Government should be starting up thousands of schemes to train people to retrofit insulation in houses and install clean heating systems. Are the Government thinking about this?</p>

    <p pid="a1079.0/1">I am pleased to tell the noble Baroness that we are already investing millions of pounds in training for green jobs under the Green Homes Grant scheme. We invested about £7 million in a training competition, and there are numerous other government schemes doing precisely what she suggested: the eco scheme, the home upgrade grant, et cetera.</p>

    <p pid="a1079.1/1">My Lords, I appreciate the helpful comments that have already been made, but I must ask the Government to leave no stone unturned in keeping this Vauxhall car plant at Ellesmere Port open—it is crucial, as people have said. Finalising an agreement with Stellantis to manufacture not one but potentially two next-generation battery-driven vehicles is crucial, securing, of course, thousands of high-skilled jobs for Ellesmere Port and, indeed, our country. Battery-driven vehicles are the future for this industry, if we are to have any future at all, and I suggest that it would be unforgiveable if the Government missed the opportunity of this investment and of securing these jobs for our country.</p>

    <p pid="a1079.2/1">I know the noble Lord’s personal commitment to the north-west, and I agree with him about leaving no stone unturned. I assure him that the Government are committed to securing the future of Ellesmere Port. The Business Secretary and his senior officials are engaging frequently with the company to explore ways to ensure that the plant stays open.

    <p pid="a1079.3/1">We have the land and the skilled workforce, and we no longer have the bureaucracy of the European Union restricting state aid to new industries. The Minister talks about the private sector—of course it needs to be there. But should we not be in the lead in the world on electric vehicles, with state money—government money—helping to make sure, as we have done with vaccines, that we are first, not second, third or fourth in this technology? Therefore, should those decisions not be made now?</p>

    <p pid="a1080.0/1">My Lords, I draw attention to my entry in the register of interests. The electric vehicle revolution can also bring thousands of well-paid jobs to areas such as the West Midlands, but that requires investment in battery technology and mass production.

Covid-19: Ethnic Minority Disparities
 - <i>Commons Urgent Question</i></major-heading>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1080.6" nospeaker="true" colnum="1080" time="13:21:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1080.5/1" class="italic">The following Answer to an Urgent Question was given in the House of Commons on Monday 1 March.</p>
    <p pid="a1080.6/1">“On Friday, I published my second quarterly report summarising the progress the Government have made in understanding and tackling Covid-19 disparities experienced by ethnic minority groups. In my first report of <phrase class="date" code="2021-10-22">22 October</phrase>, I concluded that ethnicity in its own right did not appear to be a factor in the disproportionately higher infection and mortality rates among ethnic minority groups. Rather, the evidence  showed that a range of socioeconomic and geographical factors were responsible. The evidence base continues to grow.</p>
    <p pid="a1080.6/2">The early second-wave data shows very different outcomes for different ethnic groups. In the first wave, for instance, black African men were four and a half times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white British men of the same age, but in the early part of the second wave the risk of death was the same for both groups. The second wave has, however, had a much greater impact on some south Asian groups, driven primarily by differences in exposure and infection. This strengthens the argument that ethnic minorities should not be viewed as a single group in relation to Covid-19 and means that our response to the pandemic and to the disproportionate impact that it has had on certain groups will continue to be shaped by the latest evidence.</p>
    <p pid="a1080.6/3">The other major development since my first report is the approval of three Covid-19 vaccines and the subsequent rollout of the vaccination programme, with more than 20 million of those most at risk vaccinated so far. Confidence in the vaccine among ethnic minority groups is key, and my latest report summarises our efforts over the last quarter to tackle misinformation and promote uptake.</p>
    <p pid="a1080.6/4">The report also sets out the extensive measures taken across central and local government to tackle Covid-19 disparities, including the release in January of £23.75 million in funding to local authorities under the community champions scheme and a further £4.5 million in funding for four new research projects looking at the health, social, cultural and economic impacts of Covid-19 on ethnic minority groups.</p>
    <p pid="a1080.6/5">To conclude, my report outlines a number of next steps with this work and I will update the Prime Minister on progress at the end of the next quarter.”</p>

    <p pid="a1081.0/1">ONS statistics last week showed that the unemployment rate for ethnic minorities is 9.5%, compared with 4.5% for white people. A key example of a risk factor is socioeconomic deprivation. Research shows that black, Asian and ethnic minority people are more likely to be on zero-hours contracts. One in five people on such contracts is not eligible for statutory sick pay. What plans do the Government have to address precarious work for ethnic minorities specifically? Do the Government acknowledge that this is evidence that structural racism in the labour market and socioeconomic risk factors interact?</p>

    <p pid="a1081.1/1">My Lords, we recognise that certain occupations have had an increased exposure to the virus. That is one of the risk factors for ethnic minority populations. That is why with transportation, for instance, we have issued two different sets of guidance, for private hire and for public service vehicles, and included those within the mass testing. In relation to the economic disadvantage, we are investing £30 billion in a plan for jobs to enable people who have been put out of work by the pandemic to get work.</p>

    <p pid="a1082.0/1">My Lords, the increasing levels of Covid-19 are now impacting far more on the south Asian community, particularly the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. What targeted actions involving public health and policies are being deployed to combat this? Will the Government now publish equality impact assessments on the pandemic responses, including vaccine uptake, given the clear structural social inequalities and institutional racism that have exacerbated the pandemic’s impact on the majority of ethnic minority communities?</p>

    <p pid="a1082.1/1">My Lords, the noble Baroness is correct that the report published last Friday revealed that in the second wave of the pandemic sections of the south Asian population were disproportionately affected by the virus. We have funded community champions to get the message out across certain communities through local authorities. In relation to community centres and places of worship, we have now set up asymptomatic testing centres and vaccination centres to try to increase the take-up within those communities, as getting vaccinated is the best way to protect them from the virus.</p>

    <p pid="a1082.2/1">My Lords, I commend the work and the actions undertaken by the Government to respond to the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on ethnic minorities. However, as we have heard, the data shows that socioeconomic factors are a major driver for disparities in infection rates. Ethnic minority communities are statistically more likely to be disadvantaged. Does the Minister agree that, as we emerge from the lockdown, we must not only ensure that we build on this evidence and develop appropriate responses but take steps to ensure that we reduce the level of socioeconomic disadvantage faced by sections of the minority communities as part of the levelling-up agenda?</p>

    <p pid="a1082.3/1">My Lords, the pandemic has indeed revealed many inequalities, including health inequalities across certain communities. That is not linked only to race: we also believe that certain coastal communities will have been disproportionately affected by the virus. However, we are aiming many of our schemes at those populations within the ethnic minority community; for instance, with the apprenticeship schemes we have had specific promotion to ensure that black and minority ethnic people take up those opportunities where they disproportionately do not do so.</p>

I reflect on my own home city of Leicester, where many jobs have been lost. If we are going to try to level up, as she has just said, we need to ensure that the right services and right interventions are in place. Will she consider looking at a pilot scheme to go into Leicester to do the levelling-up agenda on the skills matrix?</p>

    <p pid="a1082.5/1">My Lords, being relatively local to Leicester in origin, I pay tribute to the people of Leicester, who I think have endured the longest  period of restrictions of any part of the country. One of the few pieces of good news for the House over recent weeks has been the FE and skills White Paper and the focus on higher technical qualifications. We are focused on giving skills to people, particularly in low-income jobs, through the lifelong learning entitlement so that while earning they can train themselves up to get better-paid and better-quality work. I will take away the specific idea of a pilot to the Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills.</p>

    <p pid="a1083.1/1">My Lords, the right reverent Prelate is correct that this marginalised community is often left out. My noble friend Lord Greenhalgh, who is in the House, is leading a specific initiative out of MHCLG on this community. We now have data on the level of take-up of the vaccine in particular communities. The local directors of public health, who are the best people to know how many vaccines have been offered and how many have been taken up on the ground, should have the detailed information in the coming weeks in order to focus on that particular community in their locality.</p>

    <p pid="a1083.2/1">My Lords, ethnic minority groups have suffered disproportionately when it comes to health inequalities, economic inequalities and wealth inequality. However, any recovery post Covid will have to be UK-wide, so will the Government undertake to look at best practice and gather data so that we can compare the figures, whether from Birmingham, Belfast, Edinburgh or Cardiff, and therefore learn and overcome the divisions that have been so much more highlighted in the last year?</p>

    <p pid="a1083.3/1">My Lords, indeed, the department, among other departments, is regularly in touch with the devolved Administrations, because we want to share best practice on this. Obviously, DWP is a nationwide provision and there are more job coaches there, which we hope will enable those communities, particularly BME communities, to access work as quickly as possible if they have lost work now or lose work after furlough ends.</p>

    <p pid="a1083.4/1">My Lords, several noble Lords have quite rightly highlighted deprivation, unemployment and poverty as causes of Covid spread and I will not say anything different, though ethnicity per se does not predispose to Covid. People of ethnic origin, particularly in south Asian communities, are six times more likely to have diabetes, a condition that does predispose people to more serious impacts of Covid. Ethnic communities are also more likely to live in overcrowded accommodation and multigenerational households and to be poor. It is really poverty that kills. Can the Minister say what wider economic and social policies, including education,  income and housing, the Government will introduce to tackle the poverty gap that has got wider in the last 10 years of Conservative government?</p>

    <p pid="a1084.0/1">My Lords, the noble Baroness will be aware that the NHS has an obesity strategy and the pandemic has shone a light, helpfully, on how important that strategy is. I can comment only in relation to the role of education in this—we were on track and had seen an overall closing of the attainment gap over the last 10 years. We recognise that there has been a narrowing in the last couple of years, but we are focusing our catch-up recovery to ensure that children from disadvantaged backgrounds catch up as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p pid="a1084.1/1">My Lords, the report suggests that overrepresentation in certain generally low-paid occupations is a significant factor in the horrific death rate for people from Pakistani backgrounds. There is a lot that might be said about that with regard to structural racism, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, referred to, but in the pandemic context, does it not demonstrate that employers are not doing enough to protect workers, particularly essential workers? What more will the Government do to force employers to behave better to save lives?</p>

    <p pid="a1084.2/1">My Lords, since 1974, I believe, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act has been in force in this country and, overwhelmingly, employers take their responsibilities in this regard very seriously. The NHS, as a key employer, had by the end of last year done a risk assessment of the overwhelming majority of its ethnic minority workforce. As I said, we are also including certain groups in the mass testing asymptomatic pilots to ensure that we reduce rates of transmission.</p>

Rough Sleeping
 - <i>Statement</i></major-heading>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1084.5" nospeaker="true" colnum="1084" time="13:33:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1084.4/1" class="italic">The following Statement was made in the House of Commons on Thursday 25 February.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/1">“I would like to update the House on the Government’s progress towards ending rough sleeping. I know that many colleagues on both sides of the House share my interest and commitment to this issue, so today I am pleased to report that the rough sleeping annual statistics for 2020 have been published, and that the number of people sleeping rough across England has fallen for the third year in a row. In fact, we have seen the largest fall in rough sleeping since the annual snapshot began.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/2">Across England, the number of people sleeping rough has fallen by 37% over the past year and almost halved since this Administration took office in 2019. I am heartened that this fantastic result has been mirrored in London, where there are particular challenges in  tackling rough sleeping, but where none the less there has also been a 37% fall in the number of people sleeping rough.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/3">Some of our largest cities have seen exceptional reductions. In Birmingham, for example, the snapshot records just 17 individuals, down from 52 last year. A number of places recorded no rough sleepers at all in the statistics, including Ashford and Basingstoke. These independently verified statistics are our most robust measure of rough sleeping. They enable us to estimate the number of people sleeping rough on a single night and to compare changes over many years. As colleagues know, these numbers represent lives rebuilt, families reconnected and communities strengthened.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/4">These encouraging figures highlight the success of our ongoing Everyone In programme. We launched Everyone In almost a year ago, at the start of the pandemic, with the simple aim of bringing as many people as possible in off the streets—reducing the transmission of Covid-19, protecting the NHS and saving people’s lives. By January, Everyone In had successfully helped over 26,000 people who were either sleeping rough or in very precarious accommodation and at risk of sleeping rough to move into longer-term accommodation. Through the programme, we continue to support an additional 11,000 people in emergency accommodation while longer-term solutions are found. In total, at least 37,000 people are in safe and secure accommodation today as a result of this exceptional effort.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/5">Local authorities have each drawn up their own plans to support those accommodated during the pandemic, with our support and guidance. Those plans have been backed by £91.5 million through our Next Steps accommodation programme. Our ongoing Everyone In initiative is widely regarded as one of the most successful of its kind, and I am pleased that the United Kingdom has avoided some of the scenes that we have seen in other great cities and communities around the world, which bring shame on those places that could have done more. Research published in the Lancet showed that the measures we took in the first phase of the pandemic alone may have avoided 21,000 infections, 266 deaths, 1,100 hospital admissions and 330 intensive care admissions of homeless people.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/6">Our priority now is to ensure that we maintain this momentum and end rough sleeping altogether. To that end, we will bring forward 6,000 homes for rough sleepers, backed by over £400 million of funding, over the course of this Parliament. That is the largest investment in accommodation of this kind, and I am proud that it will leave a national legacy of support for those helped by Everyone In.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/7">Meanwhile, we will continue to invest in the initiatives that were already in place before Everyone In and that are helping to drive down the numbers of people sleeping rough. Those initiatives were created before my tenure, and I pay particular tribute to my two immediate predecessors, my right honourable friends the Members for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire) and for Bromsgrove (Sajid Javid), who put in place and reinvigorated the rough sleeping initiative created in the early 1990s by another of my predecessors, the now noble Lord Young.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/8">The £112 million of funding from our rough sleeping initiative this year has helped 291 local authorities, and further funding next year will continue to boost outreach teams, establish first-stage accommodation and introduce targeted support for mental health, employment and life skills, and wider support. We also continue to learn from and build on our Housing First pilots. The first three pilots, in Greater Manchester, Liverpool and the West Midlands, are currently supporting over 800 people into safe and secure homes. Today, we are strengthening our commitment to Housing First through the publication of the Mobilising Housing First toolkit, which sets out examples of best practice and recommendations for areas keen to implement Housing First at a local level, using the funding that we have made available.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/9">Over the course of the year, we planned and prepared for further targeted interventions to support areas with higher numbers of rough sleepers. This included the Protect programme to provide extra support to high-need areas, and the cold weather fund to bring forward additional Covid-secure accommodation over the winter. Latterly, we have had the Protect Plus programme, which helped councils to redouble their efforts and, in particular, to ensure that rough sleepers are registered with a GP, are woven into the vaccination programme in their area and receive the vaccination when their time comes.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/10">Westminster, a borough that faces unusual pressures—not least because of the very high numbers of non-UK nationals—has consistently had the highest number of people sleeping rough since the snapshot approach was introduced. As a result of this targeted approach and the exceptional efforts of the council there, we have seen very significant progress. The number of people sleeping rough in Westminster has fallen by 27% since 2019 and is believed to be at its lowest level in recent memory.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/11">In recognition of how instrumental the community, charity and faith sectors have been to our national effort, I am today announcing further funding for the voluntary sector to support its work. That will help local community night shelters to provide accommodation that is Covid-secure in time for this autumn, in case that is needed, and is dignified and focused on sensible, sustainable housing solutions for rough sleepers. It will also support Homeless Link, Housing Justice, StreetLink, St Basils and the National Homelessness Advice Service delivered by Shelter. I pay particular tribute to all those and many other community and charitable organisations.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/12">Taken together, these interventions have led to a dramatic reduction in rough sleeping of a kind not seen in many years. The additional data my department has published today shows that the number of people sleeping rough on a single night has continued to fall since the annual snapshot. Over the winter period, numbers fell to 1,743 in December and to just 1,461 in January. Many of the individuals will have been offered accommodation but will have chosen not to accept it for a wide range of reasons.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/13">While those are not official statistics of the kind of the November count that is also published today, they demonstrate the incredible achievements of council  officers and outreach staff, who have been at the front line of tackling rough sleeping in the past few months, operating under extraordinary circumstances to meet the demands of the extremely cold weather that we have seen recently. Their work is often unglamorous and unnoticed, and I pay huge tribute to them for what they have achieved.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/14">We have made great strides over the past 12 months, but we do not view that as an end in itself; it is only a beginning. In the next financial year, we will be spending more than £750 million to continue tackling homelessness and rough sleeping, so that everyone who has been extended a helping hand off the streets during the pandemic has no need to return to them again.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/15">Our ambition is that no one should need to sleep rough. To achieve that, we must raise the safety net from the street and address the causes of rough sleeping. We believe rough sleeping is a symptom of family breakdown, of domestic abuse, of the treatment of ex- offenders, of the historical inadequacies of our immigration system and, above all, of poor health, substance misuse and mental ill health.</p>
    <p pid="a1084.5/16">At the heart of the strategy that we will be laying out in the weeks and months to come will be the marriage of health and housing. The partnership between those is surely one of the central lessons of this pandemic. We will fortify those partnerships between local homelessness and health services, and between central and local government and the NHS, all of which have been strengthened enormously over the course of this year. I will work closely with the Department of Health and Social Care to tackle drug and alcohol addiction and mental ill health, and with the Ministry of Justice to ensure that prison leavers have access to housing upon release. We will seize this opportunity to build back better—not merely mending or returning to a status quo, but building a better country post Covid-19, in which no one needs to sleep rough. I commend this Statement to the House.”</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1087.0" speakername="Lord Kennedy of Southwark" type="Start Question" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24986" colnum="1087" time="13:44:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1087.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Greenhalgh, for bringing this Statement to the House this afternoon. I draw the attention of the House to my relevant registered interest as a vice-president of the Local Government Association.</p>
    <p pid="a1087.0/2">The Government promised to “bring everybody in” during the pandemic and, despite good work done in the first wave, today we sadly have many people sleeping rough again on our streets, many very close to this building. The people sleeping on the link bridge between Waterloo station and the street, who I have mentioned before, are still there: I saw them yesterday on my way to this House. According to the Government’s own figures, there were 2,688 people sleeping rough on a single night in autumn 2020. People who are homeless are three times more likely to experience a chronic health need, including respiratory conditions, putting them at higher risk of poor health outcomes, including from Covid-19.</p>
    <p pid="a1087.0/3">It is tragic that in one of the richest countries in the world, in one of the richest cities in the world, we have people sleeping rough on the streets tonight. So, can the noble Lord tell the House why the response to the  homelessness situation of people living on our streets was so much better and more effective in the first wave in comparison with the second wave? What happened in government that led to the response being so much worse this time around? What happened to the Everyone In policy? It created a safe space for people to access the support needed to move on from homelessness.</p>
    <p pid="a1087.0/4">On the wider picture of homelessness, the situation is even worse, with people living with friends and sleeping on sofas, including up to 130,000 children in England. The Government have a manifesto commitment to end the blight of rough sleeping in England by 2024. The response by the Government to this pandemic must surely be part of the plan to deliver on that commitment, and not an obstacle that puts the policy pledge in jeopardy. What we need from the Government is a strategy in place to ensure that people experiencing homelessness can move on from homelessness or expensive temporary accommodation into secure, safe, warm, dry, long-term accommodation that enables them to start rebuilding their lives.</p>
    <p pid="a1087.0/5">Local authorities should be congratulated on the work they have done, with limited funding and unclear guidance from the Government. Will the noble Lord, Lord Greenhalgh, identify for the House the various sums of money that are mentioned? Which of those are new money and not just restatements of previous funding commitments?</p>
    <p pid="a1087.0/6">Housing First is a recognised and accepted method of ending homelessness for people with multiple needs, including mental health issues and addictions. The scheme is in place in Scotland and is being piloted here in England, but the fact is that many people experiencing homelessness in England will need a Housing First offer to finally end their homelessness. There are three pilots in place, which provide around 2,000 places, but this is a long way short of the investment and commitment needed to deal with the issue finally. So when does the Minister expect a decision to be made on rolling out the scheme in England, as has already been done in Scotland, and when does he expect funding for the rough sleeping accommodation programme to ensure that a long-term housing solution is not just an aim but a reality, which is not the case today?</p>
  </speech>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1088.0" speakername="Baroness Grender" type="Start Question" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25188" colnum="1088" time="13:44:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1088.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Greenhalgh, for bringing us the Statement. There is no doubt that Everyone In last spring was a significant achievement. Louise Casey, now the noble Baroness, Lady Casey, wrote in her email at the start of the pandemic, after her first week in MHCLG:</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/2" class="indent">“I don’t care what’s happening; I don’t care what’s going on, you’ve got to get everybody in.”</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/3">Rough sleeping was treated as an urgent public health issue, resource was prioritised and brought forward, and central and local government worked in tandem with all the charities and the hotel sector and lined up safe accommodation. This was without question a success. But, as so many witnesses to the APPG for ending homelessness made clear, these numbers are never static. Homelessness, like a river, expands and grows. Substantial boulders are the only thing that stop it at source, and those boulders start with social and truly affordable housing.</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/4">Will the Minister explain why social housing build last year was only 5,716 homes, far below both Shelter’s annual target and the National Housing Federation’s goal of 145,000 social homes per year? Tomorrow in the Budget we are expecting to see a significant subsidy, not to social housing but to first-time buyers, who will be encouraged to borrow 20% of the purchase price. Will the Minister say where that money is likely to go? What is the possibility that it will end up in the profit margins of the large developers, many of which donate regularly to the Conservative Party? To prevent an increase in the number of people sleeping rough, rapid access to secure, long-term accommodation is vital. This period, following the achievement of Everyone In, is a unique opportunity to do just that and never return to the levels that were way too high just before this pandemic.</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/5">The target date of the manifesto commitment—as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy—is fast approaching, and policies need to be in place now. So surely—as the noble Lord also said—it is time to commit to a rollout of Housing First across England, instead of continuing with the pilots. The scale of current provision is 2,000 places, which falls far too short of the 16,450 places needed that were identified by the charities Crisis and Homeless Link. Can the Minister explain what is preventing the Government rolling out these successful pilots now?</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/6">It is welcome news that local authority guidance is encouraging registration of people sleeping rough with GPs, but why are the Government not following the success of some London boroughs, together with Liverpool and Oldham, which are using current JCVI guidance to vaccinate homeless people, in order to mitigate health inequalities? Some local authorities are unclear about this; will the Minister commit to clarifiying the issue? Even at the height of Everyone In some local authorities turned homeless people away. Can the Minister explain why? Does his department know why there were 2,600 people, or more, sleeping rough in October, and how many of them had no recourse to public funds?</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/7">The Statement rightly refers to research in the Lancet but not to the wider arguments used. It was clear that what was critical was the absolute refusal to resort to emergency shelters at all. So why are the Government considering using them? Large cities in the US continue to use emergency shelters, to huge detrimental effect. If social distancing is still advised next autumn, should emergency shelters not be ruled out? Can the Minister explain, in detail, in what circumstances they will be used?</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/8">The Statement refers to many of the underlying reasons for rough sleeping but fails to mention the precarious position of so many in the private rented sector. Why is that? While it is welcome that the pause on evictions has been extended, that has not stopped every stage of the process. Will the Minister acknowledge that, during the winter lockdown, 500 people were evicted from their homes and that last month 445 were either in arrears or served with eviction notices? Does the Minister agree that if the landlords’ associations and charities have united to ask for assistance, in the form of grants to tenants to keep roofs over their heads, this should be a priority to prevent homelessness?</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/9">As we continue to see the economic impact on people’s incomes, it is worrying that there is no longer-term strategy from the Government to ensure that people will be able to keep a roof over their heads. We are expecting unemployment to rise by this summer. The Government have frozen housing benefits once again. Can the Minister give reassurances that the Government are looking at ways to support people to prevent homelessness, including by helping them to avoid eviction due to arrears? Finally, is there any news on the long-awaited end to the use of Section 21, which has such an impact on vulnerable tenants?</p>
    <p pid="a1088.0/10">There are many paths to homelessness. I sincerely hope that this period has been a pause and we can move forward from here. However, unless some of the problems in areas which give rise to homelessness—such as the private rented sector—are anticipated and stopped in their tracks, we will continue to see rises in homelessness.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1090.0" speakername="Lord Greenhalgh" type="Start Answer" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25937" colnum="1090" time="13:44:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1090.0/1">My Lords, the Oral Statement relates to rough sleeping. The figures are very clear: we have seen a 37% reduction in rough sleeping—a huge reduction. There has been a reduction of 43% since the Prime Minister took office in 2019. The 2,688 statistic that was referenced by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, in his opening remarks, is down from 4,751 in 2017. This Government retain the ambition to end rough sleeping. I point out, too, that subsequent analysis, in December and January, shows continued reductions in the levels of rough sleeping.</p>
    <p pid="a1090.0/2">One of the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Grender, is not correct: the Everyone In programme continues and by January had helped 37,000 people, with over 11,000 in emergency accommodation and 26,000 moved into longer-term accommodation. The programme continues to operate, along with subsequent programmes and the Protect Plus programme.</p>
    <p pid="a1090.0/3">It is important to address the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, on funding. The commitment on homelessness and rough sleeping in the 2021 budget was £700 million, and that will increase next year—since we had a single-year budget commitment—by a further £50 million, to £750 million. Significantly, within that £750 million is a commitment to a block grant of £310 million for homelessness prevention. That grant is to ensure that there are no further pressures, and to support people at risk of homelessness.</p>
    <p pid="a1090.0/4">The noble Baroness, Lady Grender, mentioned the Government’s record on social housing. Social housing is underpinned by the multi-billion pound affordable homes grant, which has had record funding. We continue to be committed to build all forms of affordable housing, of all tenures, including social housing.</p>
    <p pid="a1090.0/5">The Housing First pilot, which was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Grender, is a world-class project. It was pioneered in Finland and we are piloting it to get the policy right. It continues to be piloted in three areas—the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region. It is important to use the findings of the evaluation, and other experiences with pilots, to inform our next steps, and we are commissioning a consortium led by the ICF to conduct  a comprehensive evaluation of the programme. When you do something new like this, it is important to test what you want to expand and expand what you test, rather than hurriedly implement something and get it wrong.</p>
    <p pid="a1090.0/6">We remain committed to removing no-fault evictions; that will happen as soon as parliamentary time allows, as I have said in previous answers. We recognise the underlying problems of people on our streets, and that we need to continue to address them. This Government, however, have made huge, unprecedented strides in reducing rough sleeping, and we continue to see that in the latest information that we have published.</p>

    <p pid="a1091.1/1">My Lords, I congratulate the Government on what has been achieved. I am particularly glad that they are trying to ensure that every rough sleeper has a GP. Can my noble friend tell the House what percentage are now registered with GPs? Furthermore, has any any study been conducted into how many are driven into homelessness by drugs and how many are driven to drugs by homelessness?</p>

    <p pid="a1091.2/1">My Lords, I thank my noble friend for showing the complexity that underpins rough sleeping. We know that 82% of rough sleepers have a mental health vulnerability; 83% have a physical health need; and 60% have substance misuse needs. We do not necessarily know the interrelationship between those problems. Getting rough sleepers vaccinated is very much part of the Protect Plus programme, which is backed by £10 million to support and urge local authorities to play their part in getting rough sleepers—whether on the streets or in emergency accommodation —vaccinated when it is their time in the queue. We also continue to work closely with NHS England and Public Health England to ensure that this vulnerable cohort of people gets vaccinated at the earliest opportunity.</p>

    <p pid="a1091.3/1">The Government are to be congratulated on the initiatives they have taken over rough sleeping during the Covid epidemic, and particularly for their success during the first lockdown. But the key question, of course, is whether there is the right policy, with adequate backing, to ensure that this is a permanent change. There were worrying signs before the pandemic that there were many more first-time rough sleepers; there was a report from Southwark recently, for example, that there are still new people coming on to the streets, with the number of applications from the homeless rising. As the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, emphasised, the problem is still there before our eyes. Of course, this has a great deal to do with the loss of jobs and the shortage of long-term accommodation, so how do the Government intend to ensure that during the difficult months ahead, we do not slip back into the old, pre-Covid situation?</p>

    <p pid="a1092.0/1">My Lords, I point to the commitment through an entire Parliament of building 6,000 new homes for rough sleepers, which is backed by over £400 million of funding. We hope to see the reductions that we have seen on the streets of London, which were in line with the national reduction of 37%, continue.</p>

    <p pid="a1092.1/1">On the issue of Covid vaccination policy for rough sleepers, is it not true that they are not treated nationally as a priority group for vaccination and that we have a postcode lottery in operation? Some areas treat them as a priority, others do not, yet they are a particularly vulnerable and difficult group. What action are the Government taking to organise a national framework for rough sleeper priority vaccination? I was concerned when I heard the Minister say, “When it is their turn in the queue”—they should be at the very front of the queue.</p>

    <p pid="a1092.2/1">My Lords, the JCVI has set the overall framework for vaccination, and there is, by definition, a queue in terms of relative vulnerability and when people are called to be vaccinated. Of course, as part of that it is important that rough sleepers are registered with their GP. Therefore, we have been working closely with local authorities—backed up by £10 million of funding—to ensure that rough sleepers are registered with GPs so that they get the vaccination when it is offered.</p>

    <p pid="a1092.3/1">My Lords, we should not be too self-congratulatory about what has happened, bearing in mind that the number of people sleeping rough on our streets is still more than 50% higher than it was a decade ago. The action around Covid has shown that taking direct action can get people off the streets. It is notable that most of those coming on to the streets are not returning but are coming on for the first time. Charities such as Crisis are warning of an imminent peak, however, as special measures, such as housing benefit increases and the temporary ban on evictions, end. Does the Minister agree that there is a real risk of a new peak in rough sleeping? What specific action will the Government take to replace these schemes, which clearly cannot continue for ever, to address this issue?</p>

    <p pid="a1092.4/1">My Lords, I recognise the risk of a cliff edge given the level of support from the Government during the Covid-19 pandemic. An important plank of the support for people at risk of homelessness is the uplift in the local housing allowance, and there has been a commitment to maintain that at the same level in cash terms. In addition, we have seen increases in universal credit and working tax credit of up to £1,040 for the year. Of course, it is a matter for the Chancellor to decide how that continues as he makes his comments in the Budget.</p>

    <p pid="a1092.5/1">My Lords, it is very good news that rough sleeping is in decline, and I congratulate the Government and all those concerned on that success. There is one difficult cohort that is not covered in the Statement: those coming temporarily from abroad,  often to beg or for other purposes, who, for instance, set up filthy encampments in Park Lane which we can all see. I understand that up to 50% of the rough sleepers in central London are in that category, and they are described as having “no recourse to public funds”. Do Her Majesty’s Government have any plans to address that issue?</p>

    <p pid="a1093.0/1">My Lords, my noble friend is right that we see more people who are either EU or non-EU foreign nationals on the streets of London. We encourage local authorities, including those in London, to connect those people with family and friends. We can also provide legal support, as well as helping them into work or training where appropriate, so there is flexibility for local authorities to do that for this group of people.</p>

    <p pid="a1093.1/1">My Lords, I acknowledge the progress of Everyone In, but the debate in the other place exposed some very disturbing factors, such as the Minister admitting wide variances across the country of the delivery of rough sleeping and homelessness services and, shockingly, that many homeless people eventually end up in poor-quality, publicly funded supported housing. What regulatory or other plans do the Government have to level up provision for rough sleepers and homeless people?</p>

    <p pid="a1093.2/1">My Lords, it is a fairly consistent national picture. I went through the data with a team as preparation for this; in every region in England we are seeing a very significant drop in rough sleeping, and they are very large in the south-east and London. It is only in the north-east, which has relatively low numbers of rough sleepers and where the figure is up by five rough sleepers according to the data, that we have some concern around not seeing a reduction. But we will continue to push the policies that are working in those areas and ensure that we encourage local authorities and others to adopt those in areas where it is proving harder to do so.</p>

    <p pid="a1093.3/1">My Lords, the excellent work done in response to Covid in housing those living on the streets followed the implementation from 2018 of the Homelessness Reduction Act, a Private Member’s Bill from Bob Blackman MP which I had the honour of piloting through your Lordships’ House. This was beginning to work well in preventing homelessness and rough sleeping. In congratulating the Minister on the several new initiatives to assist those sleeping rough, can I ask whether he is satisfied that sufficient resources are now available to all local authorities to fully implement the Homelessness Reduction Act to prevent people becoming homeless in the first place?</p>

    <p pid="a1093.4/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord on supporting my honourable friend Bob Blackman in the other place. It is an important piece of legislation, and prevention is an incredibly important priority to ensure that we do not see more people sleeping rough on our streets. I remind noble Lords that we are seeing an increase in the budget for next year to £750 million, and £310 million is for the  Homelessness Prevention Grant to do precisely what the noble Lord encourages local authorities to focus on: preventing homelessness.</p>

    <p pid="a1094.0/1">My Lords, as someone who once worked for a charity supporting homeless people, I welcome the reduction in the numbers of those sleeping rough. Rough sleeping is a blight on any civilised society and must be wholly eradicated, and I am sure that the Minister would agree. But apart from no-fault evictions and existing benefits, how do Her Majesty’s Government propose to prevent an upsurge in homelessness resulting from the end of the furlough scheme and rising unemployment—particularly among private renters, as mentioned by a number of noble Lords?</p>

    <p pid="a1094.1/1">My Lords, I cannot really comment on any additional measures. It is a matter for the Chancellor to set out the protection that we will be able to afford renters, while recognising the considerable amount that we have already done during this pandemic.</p>

    <p pid="a1094.2/1">My Lords, the Government’s commitment to end all rough sleeping is admirable. However, if this is to be achieved, they need to do much more in terms of both the immediate response to the numbers continuing to sleep on the streets and of solving the long-term causes. In relation to immediate actions, will the Government commit now to a national rollout of Housing First as soon as the pilots have been reviewed? I understand what the Minister said about the need for the pilots to be evaluated, but the fact that they are in existence must mean that the Government intend to take them further where they are working. I would hope that Housing First will have its funding increased so that around 2,000 places that are being helped by the scheme can be greatly increased to cover the numbers needing support. In the longer term, will they make a commitment that no one will be released from prison without adequate housing to go to?</p>

    <p pid="a1094.3/1">My Lords, all I can say in addition to my response to earlier questions is that the Government are committed to expanding Housing First. That commitment was made in our latest manifesto, but it is important to take on board the lessons from the three pilots.</p>

    <p pid="a1094.4/1">My Lords, like others, I welcome the Government’s commitment to end rough sleeping by the end of this Parliament and the progress being made towards that. But the Statement says, of those sleeping rough:</p>

    <p pid="a1094.5/1">My Lords, I commend my noble friend on his tireless work that started in the early 1990s with the launch of the Rough Sleepers Initiative. Recognising that the moral mission of ending rough sleeping will be difficult shows the need to work in harness not only with our health partners and  others in local authorities, but also with the community voluntary sector to deal with the underlying problems. The Housing First principle is first to find secure accommodation, then to deal with issues so that the person involved does not return to the streets.</p>

    <p pid="a1095.0/1">My Lords, homelessness and sleeping on the street is never done by choice. It is about our societal and institutional failures. Some 250,000 people, including 130,000 children, are regarded as being homeless and significant numbers of them are sleeping on the streets. They may have no recourse to public funds or be fleeing domestic violence. Among those sleeping rough, there are serious concerns about mental health and substance misuse, for which they do not have any access to services. Last year, almost 1,000 people perished on the streets.</p>
    <p pid="a1095.0/2">Through the outstanding leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady Casey, the Government have made incredible advances and provided necessary services, which is to be commended. Does the noble Lord accept that banning evictions and regulating the private rented sector, along with supporting local councils to meet and manage housing needs and additional support services, are the correct solutions? They would have the most impact and be the most genuine way of eradicating sleeping on the streets and homelessness.</p>

    <p pid="a1095.1/1">My Lords, the Government have already made a commitment to ending Section 21 no-fault evictions. I shall return to my previous answer and point out that we have seen a further decrease in the number of people aged 25 or under who have been sleeping rough this year. It is important, if we want to end rough sleeping, that we see a decrease in numbers among our young people.</p>

    <p pid="a1095.2/1">My Lords, to follow on from what the Minister said, the voluntary sector and local authorities are expressing concern about the number of young people who are rough sleepers. Can he say what is the ratio of homeless young people and what will be done to prevent them becoming homeless by, for example, providing support for conflict in families and for mental health problems, both of which have become increasingly important during Covid?</p>

    <p pid="a1095.3/1">My Lords, we have put in place bespoke support for local authorities through our homelessness advice and support team, which includes dedicated youth homelessness advisers who will inform the response to support young people. In addition, we recognise the role played by the community and voluntary sectors play if we are to end rough sleeping. That is why, included in the £6 million-worth of emergency funding, is around £100,000 that has been given to St Basils to ensure that we upskill and fund Youth Voice, which is a training scheme for young homeless people across the country.</p>

    <p pid="a1096.0/1">My Lords, I point out that in my noble friend’s constituency, the level of rough sleeping has dropped by 90%, which is one of the largest decreases in the country. On the rural figures, of course we work very carefully to ensure that the snapshot includes both rural and urban numbers. The regional figures would seem to indicate an across-the-board reduction in rough sleeping and, in particular, very steep reductions in some of our major cities.</p>

    <p pid="a1096.1/1">My Lords, the Government’s ambition to end rough sleeping is of course to be welcomed, provided that there is progress towards achieving it. I want to ask the Minister about two specific groups. One has been referred to by my noble friend Lady Blackstone. She asked what is being done about ex-offenders who find themselves sleeping rough. Can the Minister say a little more about that group? Can he also say something more about members of the Armed Forces? If they have served our country as well as they have, we have a responsibility to ensure that in the end they do not sleep rough when they are discharged. We owe them a better future than that.</p>

    <p pid="a1096.2/1">My Lords, part of the ministerial working group is looking at the issue of rough sleepers in London who are former members of the Armed Forces. I pay tribute to the work of my honourable friend in the other place, Johnny Mercer. The key is to work with local authorities to identify those people so that we can get support services to them. The support services for our Armed Forces as well as for ex-offenders are in place; it is a question of ensuring that we identify those people so that we can wrap the service support around them.</p>

    <p pid="a1096.3/1">My Lords, I declare my position as a vice-president of the Local Government Association. In the past hour, London has become the largest city in the world to call for a trial of universal basic income. An unconditional income sufficient to meet basic needs would be one way to ensure that no one ends up sleeping on the streets —that conditionality of benefits or insecurity of employment would not lead to eviction. As the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, said earlier, today’s figures report a fall in rough sleeping, but the future of rising unpayable debt, in particular among private tenants, looks grim. The Government keep saying that they will not introduce a national universal basic income, but will they support London and the 14 other local authorities that have voted for trials in their communities?</p>

    <p pid="a1096.4/1">My Lords, it is indeed blue-sky thinking to guarantee someone an income that is paid by the state. I point out that in the pandemic we have seen the national debt increase substantially to the level of our economic output for a year, which is some £2.2 trillion. In that environment,  it is very difficult to make these kinds of spending commitments, and I will certainly leave something like that to the Chancellor.</p>

    <p pid="a1097.3/1">My Lords, this order was laid before Parliament in January and is required to align the juxtaposed controls regime at the seaports of northern France with the regime currently in operation at Coquelles for the Channel Tunnel shuttle service and at the Eurostar rail terminals in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The order will replicate the legislative approach taken at the other juxtaposed control locations and enable all UK immigration legislation to be applied in the UK control zones at the ports of Calais and Dunkirk.</p>
    <p pid="a1097.3/2">The security and integrity of our borders depend on the effective enforcement of our immigration controls, particularly at the UK border controls in northern France, where each year thousands of people make perilous attempts to enter the UK illegally. It is essential that Border Force officers working at our border in northern France are empowered to carry out immigration controls to the fullest extent.</p>
    <p pid="a1097.3/3">As noble Lords will know, the UK has several international agreements with France that allow UK Border Force to operate border controls at specified ports in France. This allows Border Force officers to conduct checks on passengers and freight destined for the UK. It is a reciprocal arrangement, with French officers completing entry checks at certain points in the UK on passengers and freight destined for continental Europe. This form of pre-departure immigration control plays a crucial role in tackling irregular migration and disrupting organised immigration crime.</p>
    <p pid="a1097.3/4">Currently, Border Force conducts juxtaposed immigration controls at the ports of Calais and Dunkirk, with the French Police aux Frontières undertaking Schengen entry checks at the UK port of Dover prior to travel. The juxtaposed controls in Calais and Dunkirk are provided for at an international level by the 2003 Le Touquet treaty. This was put into effect in the UK by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (Juxtaposed Controls) Order 2003, which I shall refer to as the 2003 order. It was made under Section 141 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</p>
    <p pid="a1097.3/5">The 2003 order granted officers of the Immigration Service, as it was then known, specified immigration powers enabling them to carry out immigration controls in specified geographical locations, known as control zones, at the northern French seaports. At that time, only the powers specified in the order were necessary for the efficient and effective conduct of immigration controls. However, the way in which Border Force operates has changed in the intervening years. Officers at Calais and Dunkirk therefore now operate with fewer powers than are available to their colleagues elsewhere.</p>
    <p pid="a1097.3/6">The order under debate amends the 2003 order to grant UK Border Force officers working at the juxtaposed ports of Calais and Dunkirk the full range of immigration powers currently available to them under the Immigration Acts. This includes the power to use reasonable force, as set out in Section 146 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which is available to their counterparts at other locations.</p>
    <p pid="a1097.3/7">The order therefore empowers appropriately trained Border Force officers at the juxtaposed seaports to use reasonable force under English law when carrying out any power conferred on them by the Immigration Acts. This will enable trained Border Force staff to intervene to prevent harm where an individual’s behaviour endangers themselves, the travelling public or other Border Force staff. It will also allow trained Border Force officers to enforce compliance with immigration processes, including fingerprinting.</p>
    <p pid="a1097.3/8">Border Force officers will continue to take all reasonable steps to avoid using force, as they do elsewhere, by engaging with the individual and encouraging them to comply. Reasonable force would only ever be used as a last resort where an individual repeatedly refused to co-operate with Border Force officers and such force became necessary either for health and safety reasons or to ensure that full immigration controls were completed.</p>
    <p pid="a1097.3/9">This measure builds on the steps the Government have already taken to reform the immigration system, strengthen border controls and reduce illegal migration. It will strengthen Border Force’s ability to manage those who seek to frustrate our immigration processes or circumvent UK immigration controls, and it will ensure that Border Force officers are properly empowered to intervene to prevent harm. I beg to move.</p>

    <p pid="a1098.0/1">My Lords, I thank my noble friend for setting out the intention and effect of the order. It seems entirely reasonable. It brings the practice and powers at the French channel ports of Calais and Dunkirk into line with the practice and process at Coquelles and at the Eurostar terminals in Belgium, France and the Netherlands. I support it.</p>
    <p pid="a1098.0/2">I have some questions to ask my noble friend. Since these powers are exercised outside the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction, although they are provided for by domestic legislation, I assume that express or implied powers for Border Force officers to exercise reasonable force extraterritorially in France are contained in the provisions  of the Le Touquet treaty, which my noble friend referred to. This seems highly probable, but it will be good to hear my noble friend confirm it.</p>
    <p pid="a1098.0/3">Secondly, not only do we have border controls in France, but France exercises controls at the port of Dover. Do the French authorities exercise similar powers to those that we exercise in France?</p>
    <p pid="a1098.0/4">Thirdly, what discussions do we have with the French authorities about these matters, both specifically on these recent issues and more generally on an ongoing basis about border controls in Calais, Dover, Dunkirk and indeed at the Eurostar terminals and at Coquelles?</p>
    <p pid="a1098.0/5">The Explanatory Memorandum to the order is explicit that when the border controls were first deployed at these sea ports in 2003 the immigration powers were considered,</p>
    <p pid="a1098.0/6" class="indent">“sufficient to effectively administer immigration controls at these locations.”</p>
    <p pid="a1098.0/7">What has changed is clearly the escalation of attempts to enter the United Kingdom illegally. I understand that—I am sure that we all do—but I would be grateful if my noble friend could update the House on the current position at Calais, Dunkirk and the surrounding area. Obviously, there is real concern in your Lordships’ House on a humanitarian level, not least because of the pandemic. Could my noble friend therefore give the House an assessment of the current position and of the longer-term outlook? I appreciate that it is bound to be a changing position and perhaps fairly volatile, but it would be good to hear how the position is at the moment.</p>
    <p pid="a1098.0/8">Subject to these concerns, I strongly support what seems a very sensible provision.</p>

    <p pid="a1099.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for her introduction to the order. The controls proposed in it ensure consistency of controls across all the juxtaposed locations and bring these controls into line with current UK operations. Harmonising the legislative regime will allow greater efficiency and effectiveness in border control officers assessing passengers and improve the border process.</p>
    <p pid="a1099.0/2">Although the international sea traffic to which the order applies currently ends in England, the territorial application remains the whole of the United Kingdom. Another consequence is that the order allows immigration officers to use the full immigration powers available to them under the Immigration Acts, leading to early intervention against individuals or groups aiming to harm the UK or undertake organised immigration crime. It also extends the use of force powers, thereby allowing Border Force officers to use reasonable force if required to enforce compliance with immigration processes.</p>
    <p pid="a1099.0/3">It is right that we provide the earliest possible intervention to prevent those wishing to do us harm reaching our shores. Unfortunately, there are those who make great profit from organised immigration crime; their plans must be thwarted. At the moment, Border Force officers are not granted powers in English law to exercise force, although they have the appropriate training to do so professionally. There is evidence of numerous attempts by organised criminals to bring  people into the United Kingdom illegally through northern French seaports. Thankfully, many of them are intercepted but the officers concerned need enforcement powers for when they are presented with persons who would endanger themselves and others. Serious breaches of security must not be overlooked, and officers must be granted appropriate support to carry out their duties effectively, minimise disruption and contain sensitive situations. It is therefore imperative that we use every possible tool to keep our country safe. I support the order.</p>

    <p pid="a1100.0/1">My Lords, I, too, welcome the order. I place on record my thanks to my noble friend the Minister for dealing with this difficult area among the many difficult challenges she faces.</p>
    <p pid="a1100.0/2">My noble friend knows as well as the rest of the House does that the problem of illegal immigration across the channel seems to be growing. I have some questions. First, one wonders why it has taken quite a long time to co-ordinate seaports with the Channel Tunnel and Eurostar. In the interim, we have seen a considerable increase in illegal cross-channel traffic. Can my noble friend elucidate on what more we can do, are doing or should be doing to crack down on this form of illegal immigration?</p>
    <p pid="a1100.0/3">I am not clear whether Border Force is restricted geographically in where it can go in terms of Dunkirk and Calais; in other words, can it even operate on the beaches there? Also, does the order—I have read the whole of it—apply to the staff at ports in Belgium and the Netherlands as well? The Explanatory Memorandum states that Home Office consultation was undertaken “with operational partners”. That is good, but did any adverse reactions or difficulties come up in that consultation?</p>
    <p pid="a1100.0/4">Border Force officers do a difficult job well. At the moment, is there a shortage of men and women who are fully trained for the Border Force role? Within that role, is there any resistance to being posted to Calais or Dunkirk?</p>
    <p pid="a1100.0/5">If I may, I want to widen the issue a little. Can my noble friend the Minister clarify—certainly for me but also, I suspect, for a number of your Lordships—the law on turning back rubber dinghies? At what point can they be sent back to France, and are French officials co-operating fully?</p>
    <p pid="a1100.0/6">I am nearly at the end of my questions. On illegal immigration, which is increasing, is there a problem coming from Belgium and the Netherlands? Is there a problem for our other east coast ports, such as Hull? While I am on the subject, my noble friend may know that I take a great interest in aviation. Is there any evidence of an increased problem with our small airports, where no Border Force officers operate?</p>
    <p pid="a1100.0/7">Finally, on monitoring and review, since this illegal immigration from France is very much in the public eye, is there not a case for an annual—or biannual—review of the order’s effectiveness?</p>

    <p pid="a1100.1/1">My Lords, this is a sad piece of legislation because it perpetuates the Government’s cruel and dehumanising approach  to people who want to come to live, work and be safe in the UK. Instead of legislation to ensure safe passage and humanitarian assistance, we see new rules allowing Border Force agents to use physical force in northern French ports. Can this Government really not see that it is partly our fault that people are desperate to get to safety, away from war zones, drought, famine, floods and death? These horrible events happen either because we have sold weapons to despotic regimes or because we insist on climate-destroying activities.</p>
    <p pid="a1100.1/2">Last week, the Prime Minister seemed to understand the problem. He talked about having to deal with the security aspect of climate change, although Greenpeace called his speech “weapons-grade hypocrisy” when he is</p>
    <p pid="a1100.1/3" class="indent">“planning new coal mines at home and stripping funds for carbon-cutting energy efficiency measures.”</p>
    <p pid="a1100.1/4">I agree. He is all talk and no action—or, as my grand- mother would have said, all fur coat and no knickers.</p>
    <p pid="a1100.1/5">This “Fortress Britain” approach does not help anyone; it only pushes people into more dangerous routes of entry. The Government should fund the coastguard and RNLI lifesavers. We should be saving and helping people in dire circumstances, not increasing force and risk.</p>

    <p pid="a1101.0/1">My Lords, when looking into this order, I found myself perplexed that the legislation governing borders and border control is spread across such a great many statutory instruments. It is no wonder that there is a discrepancy between the powers permitted for use on some borders and not on others.</p>
    <p pid="a1101.0/2">I welcome that this order seeks to rectify that discrepancy by allowing the use of reasonable force where appropriate and necessary, so as to provide a unified approach for UK border officials across our international borders. However, I wonder whether it might be useful for the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee—I speak from personal experience as a past member of it—to revisit this order at some stage in the future. It is just the sort of legislation that frustrates parliamentarians—and others, presumably—because it relies on so many statutory instruments, orders and regulations, rather than the primary piece of legislation, to introduce the rules.</p>
    <p pid="a1101.0/3">I support the order but I believe that review, and perhaps consolidation, would be useful for everyone going forward.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1101.1" speakername="Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13856" colnum="1101" time="14:37:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1101.1/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations. It is a pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes.</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/2">I understand that this instrument would align the legislative regimes in place across juxtaposed control sites by extending the powers that immigration officers have to use reasonable force, where necessary, at sites such as Eurostar terminals and operations at Calais and Dunkirk.</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/3">Like the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, I have certain concerns about this piece of legislation. As a consequence of it, we are all too aware of the  tragic scenes of migrants in Calais living in horrendous conditions, fleeing war-torn countries, facing a life of uncertainty and wanting to come to the UK. In dealing with these people, a humanitarian and compassionate attitude is required while working within the legislative requirements. Many of these people have had to make the choice to leave their war-torn country, having been separated from their family and neighbours. Their villages in Syria, Iran and Yemen have been destroyed.</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/4">In that context, I have several questions for the Minister. The House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee noted that this was an instrument of interest and, in its report, indicated issues around reasonable force. Due to the fact that thousands of attempts have been made by individuals seeking to enter the UK illegally via the northern French seaports every year, and with many of those individuals not necessarily complying with immigration processes once intercepted due to the terrible conditions that they are fleeing from, it is considered necessary to grant Border Force officers at seaports the power to use reasonable force.</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/5">Can the Minister explain what is meant by “reasonable force” to take fingerprints? Will these people be restrained in some way? Will some form of physical force be used? Will they be placed in detention? Are these fingerprints taken for the purposes of deportation from the UK? What steps will the Government and Border Force officers take to ensure that no forms of xenophobia are displayed towards migrants? Will such elements of reasonable force be human rights-compliant? Have the various human rights organisations commented on this instrument and assessed its compliance with human rights legislation and international requirements in terms of respect for human beings?</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/6">I note that no impact assessment was required, a fact that was raised in the other place. Why was that the case? The order will have an impact on Border Force officials and on the individuals who could be subjected to reasonable force—of which I would like a definition. If that is the case, surely an impact assessment is required if there is going to be a significant impact, as this will be a much-enhanced operation when considered alongside the original work.</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/7">The Explanatory Note states:</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/8" class="indent">“The Home Office has consulted with operational partners, as the persons most likely to be affected by the matters in this instrument, and are continuing to work with them to implement this instrument.”</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/9">Who are these operational partners and what is the nature and extent of their work?</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/10">When is the Home Secretary bringing forward the sovereign borders Bill to reform asylum, including curbing litigious human rights claimants who seek to delay their deportation from Britain after their cases are reviewed? I understand that such legislation, which is very worrying, will make provision for judges to place more weight on asylum seekers’ criminal records when considering their appeals against deportation. Is this instrument stage one in the process as the Government move towards the sovereign borders Bill and its implementation?</p>
    <p pid="a1101.1/11">I am sad to say that I do not see much of an element of social justice in this piece of legislation. With the Covid-19 pandemic still raging, what are the requirements  for quarantine arrangements for the migrants, who have already been subjected to so much terror and trauma in their lives? I look forward to the Minister providing answers to these questions.</p>

    <p pid="a1103.0/1">My Lords, this SI has been prepared by the Home Office. The purpose of the order is to harmonise the legislative regimes across the juxtaposed controls, thereby also extending the powers to use reasonable force, as set out in Section 146 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, to the juxtaposed controls at the northern French seaports. The UK currently operates border controls at ports in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. This allows Border Force officers to conduct immigration checks in the same locations, policing and goods checks relating to passengers and freight destined for the UK before they begin their journey.</p>
    <p pid="a1103.0/2">This is a reciprocal arrangement with the French officers who conduct entry checks at ports in the UK on passengers and freight destined for continental Europe. This optimises the efficiency of border control processes and provides earlier intervention to prevent those who seek to do harm from reaching the UK and are crucial to tackling irregular migration and disrupting organised immigration crime.</p>
    <p pid="a1103.0/3">With thousands of attempts made by persons seeking to enter the UK illegally via the northern French seaports every year, and with many of those individuals not complying with immigration processes once intercepted, it is necessary to grant Border Force officers at the juxtaposed-control seaports, the power to use reasonable force where strictly necessary when non-compliant persons present a danger to themselves or others.</p>
    <p pid="a1103.0/4">Will children wishing to join their families or relatives be protected and allowed to enter the UK?</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1103.1" speakername="Lord Paddick" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25204" colnum="1103" time="14:45:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1103.1/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for explaining these amendments. This has been an extremely wide-ranging debate.</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/2">If I have understood the Minister correctly, powers are given to United Kingdom officials in control zones in northern France, Belgium and Holland, and to French, Belgian and Dutch officials at Channel Tunnel control zones in the UK, to enable the enforcement of immigration law at the border before passengers enter the destination country. These powers include arrest, detention and the seizure of documents, and for offences committed in control zones to be treated as if they had been committed in the destination country. Arrangements at Channel Tunnel control zones are provided by different legislation: the Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) Order 1993 in relation to French control zones and the Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1994 in relation to Belgian control zones.</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/3">According to the Explanatory Notes, one part of these regulations is to reconcile the regime at the juxtaposed-control seaports in northern France with that for international rail services via the Channel Tunnel. The other part, Article 2, extends all immigration  enactments to control zones in France and makes the necessary modifications to other enactments to ensure that UK immigration controls are able to function properly in those control zones. Why not Belgium? Are there no international agreements between us and Holland? What steps are being taken to extend arrangements to Belgium and Holland?</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/4">In effect, this measure ensures a consistent approach to the Channel Tunnel and seaport control zones in France, and that UK immigration law can be effectively enforced within those control zones as if the control zones were in the UK. However, the Explanatory Note fails to explain that French officers operating in control zones within the UK are to be treated as if they were UK immigration officials in relation to offences committed or omitted in relation to an immigration officer, including assaulting an immigration officer.</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/5">What I am concerned about, and I hope the Minster can clarify this, is that if the arrangements are entirely reciprocal, there appears to be some kind of double jeopardy where a person could be committing an offence under both British and French law. For example, someone who assaults a French official in a control zone in the UK could be prosecuted both in the UK and in France, were the French to have equivalent legislation to these regulations. If that were the case, who would have precedence in terms of prosecution? Would it depend on whether it was a French national or a British national? My concern is enhanced by the addition of Article 12(7) to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Juxtaposed Controls) Order 2002, which states:</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/6" class="indent">“Any jurisdiction conferred by virtue of this article on any court is without prejudice to any jurisdiction exercisable apart from this article by any French court.”</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/7">The regulations appear to significantly expand the enactments having effect in a control zone in France from a specific and limited number of enactments in the 2002 order to all immigration control enactments; the Minister explained that the remit of Border Force officers has expanded since 2002. Even if that is necessary and proportionate, for the sake of clarity should the regulations list those immigration control enhancements so that people know exactly what they are subject to?</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/8">The regulations appear to remove the protections provided by the Data Protection Act in relation to data processed in a control zone in France in connection with immigration control. Why is that necessary and proportionate?</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/9">On the issue of reasonable force, can the noble Baroness confirm that such powers are already available to Border Force officers where they operate elsewhere and are not an additional power exercisable only under this order?</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/10">When I got to this stage of examining the regulations, I had to admit defeat. Can the Minister explain what exactly the effect of the following is? I quote from close to the bottom of page 2 of the order:</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/11" class="indent">“(b) in paragraph 2 (modification of the Terrorism Act 2000 …  (i) in sub-paragraph (1)—(aa) after paragraph (d), insert—‘(da) in paragraph 5A omit the words “or 3”;’; (bb) after paragraph (e), insert—‘(ea) in paragraph 6A omit the words “or 3” in each place where they occur”.</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/12">I could go on in a similar vein. If the Minister cannot explain the precise effect of these changes now, from the Dispatch Box, how are we supposed to make sense of this impenetrable legislation? I could go on, with pages and pages of similar changes in these regulations where it is not clear at all from the regulation or the Explanatory Memorandum what changes this order brings about.</p>
    <p pid="a1103.1/13">The Explanatory Memorandum basically says that the order makes other amendments to the 2003 order and makes the necessary modifications to other enactments to ensure that UK immigration controls function properly in the control zones. In effect, it says “just trust us”. My Lords, I do not.</p>

    <p pid="a1105.0/1">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 permits the making of an order to provide for a law of England and Wales to have effect at a juxtaposed control at an EEA port. At present, the juxtaposed control locations governed by such an order in 2003 are at the ports of Calais and Dunkirk in France and, for the French authorities, at Dover.</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/2">Unlike their counterparts at UK ports and other juxtaposed locations, Border Force officers working at the northern French seaports have not been explicitly empowered under domestic law to use reasonable force if necessary to carry out their duties when dealing with serious breaches of security at the port, including in relation to those seeking to enter the UK. This order aligns</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/3" class="indent">“the regime at the sea ports of Northern France with the regime currently in operation at the juxtaposed locations in Coquelles and at Eurostar terminals in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, where the full range of immigration powers are available to fully trained officers.”</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/4">National security is a key issue for us, and we are not opposed to the order. However, I have a few questions about the impact of the order in the absence of any impact assessment.</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/5">In paragraph 12.3, the Explanatory Memorandum states:</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/6" class="indent">“An Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this instrument because there is no, or no significant, impact on the private or public sector.”</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/7">However, in paragraph 14.1, the Explanatory Memorandum says:</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/8" class="indent">“Impacts will be monitored through regular collection and analysis of use of force data as well as the existing internal review system.”</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/9">On the one hand, the Explanatory Memorandum says that there will be</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/10" class="indent">“no, or no significant, impact on the private or public sector”,</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/11">but, on the other hand, it says that “impacts will be monitored.” Could the Government explain this apparent contradiction in their response? What impacts are going to be monitored that will have no impact, or no significant impact, on the private or public sector?</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/12">Will this order have any impact on the number of people entering the UK without authority through the northern French ports? If so, what impact will it have? If it will not have any impact, what purpose does the order serve? At other juxtaposed control locations, where Border Force officers already have powers to use reasonable force, on how many occasions per week  or month on average do they have to use these powers? How far can they go in exercising “reasonable force”? What actions does it cover and what actions does it not cover? Are Border Force officers who can use reasonable force also armed officers or are they ever armed officers?</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/13">The Explanatory Memorandum refers to Border Force officers able to use “reasonable force” as being fully trained. How long does it take to train a Border Force officer in the appropriate exercise of “reasonable force”? Will enabling Border Force officers to use reasonable force at the northern French ports mean that fewer officers will need to be deployed or will the change provided for in this order have no impact on staffing levels? How will we assess the impact of this change, in respect of the use of reasonable force, on national security?</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/14">In paragraph 7.4, the Explanatory Memorandum refers to</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/15" class="indent">“thousands of attempts made by persons seeking to enter the UK illegally via the Northern French seaports every year”.</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/16">Are the Government saying that, because the power to use reasonable force is not currently available to Border Force officers at these ports, more people have entered the UK without authority through them as a result? In which case, why has it taken this length of time to bring forward this order? Have concerns been raised by the French authorities that Border Force officers do not have sufficient powers in relation to reasonable force and that that increases the responsibilities and workload of the French authorities? Once this order is in force, what impact will it have on the numbers of people entering the UK without authority via the northern French seaports?</p>
    <p pid="a1105.0/17">I hope the Government can provide answers to all the questions raised in the debate, including those relating to people genuinely fleeing persecution. One would like to think that this order is designed and intended to improve national security in a meaningful and measurable way, and that it is not just about ensuring uniformity across juxtaposed control locations for the sake of it.</p>

    <p pid="a1106.0/1">My Lords, there were indeed a lot of questions, some relating to this SI and others slightly outside it. I will happily try to answer as many questions as I can, and I will write to noble Lords where I cannot.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/2">I hope I have made it clear that the integrity of the UK’s immigration system depends on the effective enforcement of the Immigration Rules. This measure empowers Border Force staff based at the ports of Calais and Dunkirk to exercise their powers to the fullest extent at the UK border controls in northern France.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/3">Border Force officers will always seek first to engage with the individual, explaining the requirement to comply with immigration controls and encouraging the individual to do so. This order will allow suitably trained Border Force officers to exercise reasonable force, where necessary, to enforce compliance with immigration processes, where, for example, an individual attempts to abscond from Border Force custody or refuses to provide their fingerprints. It will also allow  trained Border Force officers to intervene if a person’s conduct endangers themselves, Border Force staff or, indeed, the public. I assure noble Lords that such reasonable force would be exercised only as a last resort and only where its use is considered necessary, justified and proportionate. I hope that answers the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Ritchie.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked about training. Training will be provided and only Border Force officers who have been suitably trained will be permitted to use force when carrying out their duties—and only where it is absolutely necessary, justified and proportionate. The Home Office provides Border Force staff with comprehensive training on the use of force and officers are required to refresh this training annually.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/5">On fingerprinting, it is correct that there have been some low levels of non-compliance with fingerprinting at Coquelles, where we are already able to exercise these powers. When encountered, officers have been able to use their training to contain and resolve the situation. It is inevitable that Border Force officers will occasionally encounter non-compliance, but they are trained to deal effectively with these situations; as I have said, they undergo comprehensive training. All incidents involving the use of force are recorded and may, where appropriate, be subject to review and/or investigation so that we can continue to ensure the safety of our staff and ensure that training is sufficient.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/6">I now come to some specific questions. I welcome my noble friend Lord Bourne’s support for this SI. He asked about the juxtaposed controls and EU exit. The juxtaposed border controls are not an EU construct. They have been established through bilateral and multilateral arrangements with partners in France, Belgium and the Netherlands and allow the officers of each state to exercise controls as they would in their own territory. For the UK, this includes officers being permitted to use reasonable force where necessary, as I have said, when carrying out their duties, such as when fingerprinting irregular migrants and in cases where they have to intervene if a non-compliant individual’s conduct endangers themselves or other people.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/7">My noble friend asked about the situation in Calais. The package of support that we have agreed with the French covers four broad areas. It has increased the number of gendarme reservists, with double the number of officers patrolling French beaches from <phrase class="date" code="2021-12-01">1 December</phrase> last year. We have increased surveillance and technology. We have improved port infrastructure to reduce opportunities for smuggling, and we have reception centres, which support migrants into appropriate and safe accommodation in France, informing and enabling them to access the asylum system in France, and taking them out of the hands of criminal gangs.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/8">My noble friends Lord Bourne and Lord Naseby asked about consultation. We have, of course, co-operated closely with the French for many years to tackle irregular migration and maintain the integrity of our shared borders. The measure will strengthen UK border controls at the juxtaposed seaports of Calais and Dunkirk and we are continuing to work closely with our French partners on implementation. My noble friend Lord Naseby asked about any adverse reaction to this; the answer is no—so far there has not been any.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/9">My noble friend Lord Bourne asked whether oversight was in place to ensure that the power is properly exercised. Reasonable force would be exercised only as a last resort and only where its use is considered necessary, justified and proportionate. Border Force has robust internal procedures in place to ensure that its officers are exercising this power correctly. As I said earlier, every incident involving the use of force is recorded and, where appropriate and proportionate, reviewed locally by senior Border Force staff and/or the Home Office’s operational safety unit. Incidents involving serious professional misconduct may be subject to full internal investigation, including, where appropriate, by the professional standards unit. Border Force functions at the juxtaposed controls are overseen by a number of external oversight bodies, including the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration and HM Inspector of Prisons.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/10">The noble Lord, Lord Paddick, asked about French officers based at Dover. This order relates to the powers of UK Border Force officers based at the juxtaposed seaports in France. The international agreements that underpin these juxtaposed controls allow the officers of each state to operate immigration controls as they would in their own territory, as he articulated; therefore, British and French law may not necessarily align in this regard. French officers carrying out immigration controls at Dover already have the power under their domestic law to use reasonable force where necessary. The Le Touquet agreement already allows UK and French authorities to use their full range of powers in their respective control zones.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/11">To expand on the point I made to the noble Baroness, Lady Ritchie, about fingerprinting, it is migrants who attempt to circumvent UK immigration controls who may be fingerprinted.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/12">My noble friend Lord Naseby asked what more we can do. We have the sovereign borders Bill coming up—I cannot give an exact date, but it will be soon—which completely overhauls the system to allow for safe and legal routes to this country. My noble friend asked whether there were any objections among our staff to moving to France. I do not know, but I will find out if I can. He asked about constraints on the turning back of rubber dinghies—although this is outside this statutory instrument. The constraints will be dependent on whose waters the boat is in. Clearly, in the Channel, some of the opportunities to turn back do not spread across a great distance at all. He asked about problems with small airports and extensions to other ports. I would imagine—but shall confirm—that extensions to other ports will be considered in due course should the demand arise.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/13">The noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, basically asked why we were being so cruel in our use of reasonable force. This use was set out in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. It is not a new thing; it is 22 years old and well established. My noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes asked why there is so much legislation. Of course, we are overhauling the system through the sovereign borders Bill, which will be with us soon. Both the noble Baroness, Lady Ritchie, and the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked about the impact assessment. The lack of an impact assessment is because this SI is purely about how UK officers  operate in France. The noble Lord, Lord Bhatia, asked about children joining their parents. This is outlined in the existing Immigration Rules, in Appendix FM.</p>
    <p pid="a1106.0/14">I hope that I have answered noble Lords questions as far as I can today. I will write to noble Lords if I have missed anything out. With that, I beg to move.</p>

    <p pid="a1109.5/1">My Lords, the purpose of these regulations, laid under Sections 23(2) and 24(7) of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, is to give effect to the authority to carry scheme 2021; to make consequential amendments to the Authority to Carry Scheme (Civil Penalties) Regulations 2015 and to revoke the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (Authority to Carry Scheme) Regulations 2015. Once given effect, the 2021 scheme will, in turn, replace and revoke the authority to carry scheme 2015.</p>
    <p pid="a1109.5/2">Authority to carry is, in effect, the UK’s no-fly scheme. It is necessary to prevent certain individuals from travelling to—or from—the UK, when it is necessary in the public interest. The scheme is operated by the National Border Targeting Centre, which processes information about individuals, both passengers and crew, intending to travel to or from the United Kingdom. Where an individual is identified who is in a class of  person described in the scheme, the carrier may be refused authority to carry the individual to or from the UK.</p>
    <p pid="a1109.5/3">Authority to carry is a key part of the UK’s border security arrangements, preventing individuals—including known terrorists, serious criminals and those subject to sanctions—from being able to travel to the UK. The 2021 scheme applies to all carriers who have been required by law to provide passenger and crew information before departure. It applies on all international routes to and from the UK, as well as to routes to and from the UK from within the common travel area where advance passenger and crew information is received from a carrier.</p>
    <p pid="a1109.5/4">The operation of the authority to carry scheme has been extremely successful. Since its introduction in March 2015, the National Border Targeting Centre has refused carriers authority to carry individuals seeking to travel to the UK on more than 8,200 occasions. This has included around 200 individuals excluded from the UK, around 3,300 individuals previously deported from the UK, and more than 4,700 individuals using invalid, lost, stolen or cancelled travel documents. It has also included subjects of international travel bans. Those individuals would otherwise have arrived in the UK and been refused leave to enter by Border Force officers. The carrier would have been required to remove them and, in some cases, meet their detention costs. Some of those individuals, once in the UK, might have taken the opportunity to challenge their removal.</p>
    <p pid="a1109.5/5">The 2021 scheme builds on the 2015 scheme by including additional classes of individuals whom carriers may be refused authority to carry when travelling to the UK. These are: individuals whose visa has been cancelled or revoked; individuals who have been refused leave to enter the UK before their departure for, or in the course of their journey to, the UK; and individuals who are using a travel document that is known to include a false or counterfeit visa or endorsement. One additional class of individual is included in the 2021 scheme in respect of whom carriers may be refused authority to carry when travelling from the UK: individuals using an invalid, lost or stolen travel document.</p>
    <p pid="a1109.5/6">Although the 2015 scheme provides for the refusal of authority to carry from the UK, as does the proposed 2021 scheme, there has not yet been a case where this has proven necessary. Ports police provide the first response and will intervene prior to departure, rather than the carrier being refused authority to carry. However, by including this outbound class, we will engage carriers to inhibit the use of passports where the Passport Office has notified the applicant that their document should not be used for travel. Equally, there is a need for a replacement scheme following the end of the EU transition period and ahead of the end of the citizens’ rights grace period at the end of June.</p>
    <p pid="a1109.5/7">The draft 2021 scheme brings into scope the subjects of travel bans made under the new UK sanctions regime established by the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018. Subjects of United Nations and United Kingdom travel bans will be in scope of the 2021 scheme.</p>
    <p pid="a1109.5/8">The proposed 2021 scheme removes the distinction that was apparent in the 2015 scheme between EEA and third-country nationals excluded or deported—or in the process of being excluded or deported—from the UK. This is important ahead of the end of the citizens’ rights grace period. The Government are absolutely committed to ensuring the continued safety and security of the UK border. This new authority to carry scheme is central to that effort. I beg to move.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1111.0" speakername="Baroness Warsi" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13937" colnum="1111" time="15:52:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1111.0/1">My Lords, as my noble friend has said, these regulations bring into force the authority to carry scheme 2021, which replaces the authority to carry scheme 2015. I apologise in advance to my noble friend about where I want to take this debate today because it is both timely and necessary in relation to these regulations.</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/2">These regulations, which protect the United Kingdom and its citizens, ensure that those whom we do not believe are conducive to the public good are not allowed to enter. They create a mechanism underpinned by financial penalties to ensure the practical application of this protection. However, they also include our responsibility to ensure that we do not allow individuals from abroad who intend to cause harm to others and to us to leave these shores. These regulations stop people from being both carried here and carried from here—as well as, of course, providing the Secretary of State a mechanism to require carriers to remove people upon deportation.</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/3">The Explanatory Memorandum published by the Home Office alongside the regulations provides further policy background detail, some of which my noble friend has referred to, so my quotation does slightly duplicate. I quote the Government’s guidance:</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/4" class="indent">“Preventing individuals from travelling to or from the UK”—</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/5">the latter is my emphasis—</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/6" class="indent">“is an important part of the UK’s border security arrangements. The ability to intervene, pre-departure and prevent travel has meant that, under the 2015 Scheme, the Home Office has refused carriers authority to carry around 8,000 individuals”,</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/7">as my noble friend has referred to, and she has detailed the various categories of those. The quotation continues:</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/8" class="indent">“It also included one member of a flight crew who had been previously deported. These are all individuals who would otherwise have travelled to the UK and would have been dealt with at the border, with the resulting financial and time implications associated with processing, detaining and removing that individual.”</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/9">The regulations detail that authority to carry from the UK may be refused in respect of various categories of persons, of which one is children whom the Secretary of State has reasonable cause to believe are intending to leave the United Kingdom for the purposes of involvement in terrorist-related activity.</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/10">I want to ask the Minister some questions on this “from” element, in relation to what I term our responsibility to prevent our citizens from causing harm by travelling overseas, including harm to themselves—these are children we are talking about. Noble Lords will be familiar with the case of Shamima Begum, the 15 year-old girl from east London who, along with her teenage school friends, travelled to Syria to become a bride to ISIS recruits. Her tragic story is of a young women groomed, abused  and now left stateless in a refugee camp, having given birth to and lost two children, both British nationals, and, five years later, at the age of 20, attempting to return home.</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/11">We stripped her of her citizenship, despite her being born a British citizen and having only ever lived here. She was deemed by the then Secretary of State to be a Bangladeshi citizen—a country she does not know and has never taken citizenship of and which has said will not grant her citizenship. It has also said that, if she tried to enter that country, she would be subjected to being sentenced to death because of her association with ISIS.</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/12">As such, I will ask the following questions, and, if my noble friend cannot answer them today, I look forward to receiving a written reply. First, how many British citizens have been prevented from travelling overseas under the scheme to date? Secondly, how many children did we protect from becoming involved in terrorism by preventing them from travelling? Thirdly, carriers face a penalty for failing in their duty to protect if they carry someone to the UK under these regulations; what is the Government’s thinking when we fail in our duty to protect by allowing a person—someone who should have been protected and prevented from travelling under these regulations—to travel? Fourthly, what practical measures do the Government take to fulfil their responsibility to prevent individuals in the categories that they refer to in the regulations from travelling?</p>
    <p pid="a1111.0/13">Finally, does my noble friend agree with me that we have a right to protect our country by revoking the citizenship of those who intend to cause us harm? That is absolutely a right that we have. However, does she also agree with me that that decision should be based on the harm intended, the crime committed or a crime that may be committed, not on the British national’s heritage?</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1112.0" speakername="Lord Dodds of Duncairn" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10857" colnum="1112" time="15:57:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1112.0/1">My Lords, I am very grateful to the Minister for the clear way in which she has outlined the purpose and details of these regulations; I welcome what they are designed to achieve.</p>
    <p pid="a1112.0/2">The new legislation will reflect the changes that have been brought about as a result of Brexit and some of the sanctions now available under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018. I certainly endorse the addition of the new classes of individuals who can now be made subject to a refusal of authority to carry. This is all very welcome and will help to safeguard the people of the United Kingdom, preventing unnecessary travel to and from the United Kingdom by people who should not be here—in the case of people who wish to travel to it and are not eligible for entry. Without it, there would be gaps and loopholes in the statute book, which would be impossible to justify.</p>
    <p pid="a1112.0/3">Given that this is a UK-wide piece of legislation, covering Northern Ireland and, of course, Scotland, the same regulations and obligations will apply to carriers to and from Northern Ireland from abroad as apply in other parts of the United Kingdom. Today,  I am interested in exploring with the Minister the application, implementation and enforcement of the duties and requirements under these regulations, given that Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom with a land border with another country and given that we have the common travel area, to which the Minister referred, covering the whole of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic.</p>
    <p pid="a1112.0/4">Since we have an open border with the Irish Republic for people under the common travel area arrangements, people travelling into the Irish Republic from abroad by seaport or airport can travel into Northern Ireland and cross over into the rest of the United Kingdom without necessarily having any further checks made upon them after their arrival in the Irish Republic.</p>
    <p pid="a1112.0/5">The Minister referred to the application of the regulations to carriers to the UK by way of the common travel area. If the endpoint is the United Kingdom, someone may well decide to travel into the Irish Republic, stay for a period, and then come into the United Kingdom at a later point. I would be grateful if the Minister could outline how the provisions of the regulations apply in relation to carriers of individuals who are not eligible to be in the United Kingdom, and who may decide to use Dublin, or another Irish port of entry, as a means of accessing the United Kingdom in this fashion.</p>
    <p pid="a1112.0/6">Do we have the same reporting and other obligations on carriers travelling into the Irish Republic in respect of people who are ineligible to travel to the UK? What is the level of co-operation and exchange of information and details between the Irish and UK border authorities? What obligations are the Irish border authorities under and how can we be sure that they are being properly and rigorously monitored? How is the system of enforcing fines implemented if people who are ineligible to enter the UK are carried into the Irish Republic and then come into the United Kingdom?</p>
    <p pid="a1112.0/7">Clearly, this is a matter of considerable interest to people in Northern Ireland and is something that is worthy of reassurance to citizens, not just in Northern Ireland but in other parts of the United Kingdom. Given the common travel area arrangements, the systems to control the Irish border—its ports and airports—must be as robust in relation to incoming international travel as those for airports and seaports in the United Kingdom itself.</p>
    <p pid="a1112.0/8">In welcoming the legislation before us, I seek the Minister’s reassurance that these necessary and important regulations are not in any way undermined or weakened as a result of the current arrangements within the common travel area. I fully support the common travel area arrangements in principle; they have worked to the advantage of both the United Kingdom and citizens of the Irish Republic, and, of course, they pre-date European Union membership. I just want to be assured that in these regulations we have covered all bases and that people cannot use the common travel area arrangements as some kind of back door, and that carriers cannot evade their responsibilities by using them or by means of not having the regulations properly enforced against them if these circumstances were to arise.</p>
  </speech>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1114.0" speakername="Lord Paddick" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25204" colnum="1114" time="16:03:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1114.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for explaining these regulations. As other noble Lords have said, the 2015 scheme that they replace had a sunset clause, meaning that it would cease to have effect in April 2022, but these regulations have been introduced early because of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union. That means that certain high-harm individuals who would have fallen outside the scope of the 2015 scheme can now be included in the 2021 scheme, including those who are subject to travel-related sanctions under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018.</p>
    <p pid="a1114.0/2">I have a great deal of sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the questions that she asked about Shamima Begum. However, the Minister said, if I heard her correctly, that no one had been prevented from leaving the UK under the 2015 regulations, even though that is possible, and that police at the UK border would be used to prevent people departing in the circumstances that the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, outlined. Although the noble Baroness asked very important questions, I am not sure that they are related to these regulations.</p>
    <p pid="a1114.0/3">As far as the operation of the scheme is concerned, I have a few questions that I hope the Minister may be able to answer. If she cannot today, perhaps she could write to me. I understand that a visa may be cancelled or revoked, and that the carrier may not be aware this has happened, but an increasing number of travellers are able to visit the UK without a visa. The Government did not take the opportunity of leaving the European Union to require visas for entry into the UK from EU, EEA and Swiss nationals but instead extended visa-free entry using the e-passport gates to citizens of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States of America. Rather than taking back control of our borders, this Government threw them open to citizens of seven new countries and kept them open for EU, EEA and Swiss nationals.</p>
    <p pid="a1114.0/4">The Minister talked about the importance of the scheme and how people could be denied authority to travel, rather than being turned away at the UK border. But the question has to be: how can they be turned away at the UK border if they do not require a visa and can use the e-passport gates? As a result of all these additional people being able to enter the UK without a visa, the authority to carry scheme becomes even more important as checks carried out when someone applies for a visa, which could prevent those who should be prevented from entering the UK, have been ditched in relation to millions of potential visitors to the UK. Indeed, visa checks could reveal that someone previously unknown to the authorities should not be allowed to enter the UK—something the authority to carry scheme is unlikely to pick up.</p>
    <p pid="a1114.0/5">The Minister talked about the carriers having to provide information on passengers and crew prior to departure. How long before departure do these details have to be provided, and therefore what timescale do UK officials have to respond to that information to prevent people boarding aircraft, for example? On the general question, why did the Government not take the opportunity of leaving the European Union to  require more people visiting the UK to have visas, so increasing the security at the border, but instead threw the borders open to nationals from even more countries?</p>
    <p pid="a1114.0/6">The authority to carry scheme applies only to carriers which have been required to submit details comprising passenger and crew information and, in some cases, according to the draft scheme, in respect of some routes only. Why not all carriers and routes? What are the chances of someone who wishes to enter the UK but should be prevented from doing so from entering it using carriers or routes where no requirement is made to submit such information or, as the noble Lord, Lord Dodds, has just said, evading the authority to carry scheme altogether by entering the UK through Ireland and the common travel area?</p>
    <p pid="a1114.0/7">Carriers can provide passenger and crew information voluntarily and it is then treated as a request for authority to carry. What happens if the information is not volunteered and there is no opportunity to refuse such authority?</p>
    <p pid="a1114.0/8">Persons in respect of whom authority to carry may be refused include individuals who are the subject of an exclusion order under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016. I refer again to the draft scheme. These regulations give effect to certain judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union—CJEU—and address issues concerning the practical application of directive 2004/38/EC within the United Kingdom. Is the UK still bound by these EU directives and judgments of the CJEU?</p>
    <p pid="a1114.0/9">Finally, to what extent has the existing authority to carry scheme relied on the Schengen Information System —SIS II—to identify those who should be barred from entering the UK? Specifically, of the 8,000 individuals the Home Office has refused carriers authority to carry, how many were refused entry on the basis of information provided by SIS II—a database that we no longer have access to?</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1115.0" speakername="Lord Kennedy of Southwark" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24986" colnum="1115" time="16:10:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1115.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for her explanation of the purpose of these regulations. I put on record that the Labour Party gives the Government, the security agencies, the police and other law enforcement agencies our full support in their fight against terrorism and criminality in all its forms.</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/2">I welcome the measures that strengthen protections at UK borders as they help keep people safe. I noted in the Explanatory Memorandum that the Home Office has refused carriers the authority to carry 8,000 individuals seeking entry to the UK, including 3,000 individuals previously deported from the UK, 4,600 individuals using lost or stolen travel documents, and 180 individuals previously excluded from the UK.</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/3">Further, I welcome that these measures support and relieve the pressure on hard-working UK border officials and other operational partners. They save time and money, enhance our security, and stop those who would otherwise be prevented from entering at the border even attempting to make the trip.</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/4">I am fully aware of the context for why these measures were in place in the first place: as an additional measure to stop fighters travelling to and from Syria and Iraq. I fully support that aim.</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/5">I have a few questions that I hope the Minister will be able to answer. First, the Explanatory Memorandum does not make it clear when the updated guidance will be provided on the operation of the scheme and the penalties for non-compliance. Can the Minister tell the House when this guidance will be forthcoming?</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/6">Can the Minister confirm that the maximum penalty will be £50,000? How many carriers have been fined and what was the level of the fine imposed on them? Further, is there a mechanism for uprating the fine so that it keeps pace with inflation? Has the Home Office undertaken any assessment of the deterrent effect of a fine of up to £50,000? If not, is there a plan to do so? If no assessment has been undertaken and there are no plans for one, how do we know that this is the correct figure to provide that deterrent effect?</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/7">Can the Minister say a little bit about the carriers’ compliance with the scheme generally? What can the Government do to a carrier that is in persistent breach of its obligations under these regulations beyond imposing a monetary penalty?</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/8">The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, made valid points about the regulations being here to prevent people leaving the UK, as well as people arriving into the UK. She raised the tragic case of Shamima Begum, and legitimate questions about how this matter can be resolved that need to be answered. The case raises important public policy matters that the Government have to resolve about our obligations to the wider international community.</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/9">The noble Lord, Lord Dodds of Duncairn, spoke about the risk of individuals who would otherwise not be eligible to travel to the UK seeking access through the Republic of Ireland. It would be good to hear about the measures in place that support the freedoms we enjoy in the common travel area. As the noble Lord said, we cannot have carriers evading their responsibilities under these regulations. To be clear: I fully support the common travel area. Other than my immediate family, all my family live in the Republic of Ireland, so I have made use of the common travel area from my youngest days. I have travelled backwards and forward there many times. I fully support it, but the noble Lord raised a valid point.</p>
    <p pid="a1115.0/10">With those questions, I am happy to support the regulations before the House. I look forward to the Minister’s response.</p>

    <p pid="a1116.0/1">My Lords, I thank noble Lords who took part in the debate. As with the previous debate, some of the contributions had nothing to do with the SI, but that has never stopped noble Lords before.</p>
    <p pid="a1116.0/2">My noble friend Lady Warsi asked, with reference to the Shamima Begum case, how many children we prevented from travelling overseas. We never refused authority to carry in respect of any children. The provision was put in place in response to Shamima Begum and her friends, but it has never been used. On what practical measures we take to stop children travelling, as I said, it has not been necessary to refuse any carrier authority to carry from the UK. Of course, ports police will intervene where adults or children of concern  or at risk may seek to travel from the UK. In terms of wider practical support, there is the Prevent programme, which has, as its name suggests, prevented children from getting engaged in what might be terrorism down the line.</p>
    <p pid="a1116.0/3">The noble Lord, Lord Dodds, asked about Ireland to GB. Where advance passenger information—API—is available ahead of travel, authority to carry can be refused from Ireland to GB. There is no reporter requirement under UK law for airlines operating flights to Ireland to provide that information to UK Border Force. Information about persons of concern to the UK and Ireland is shared between the respective border control authorities. The same is true with other countries, in response to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Paddick.</p>
    <p pid="a1116.0/4">I will have to get back to the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, on when guidance will be provided. He is right about the fine: it is £50,000. There have been 51 breaches of the 2015 scheme, with 18 penalties imposed on airlines for non-compliance, totalling just over £186,000. He asked about uprating. I do not know the answer to that question so will have to get back to him—I am not going to blag my way through that—but I add that airlines are very pleased about this, because it gives them clarity, which always helps. They have been looking for this for a very long time.</p>
    <p pid="a1116.0/5">Regarding the treatment of EEA nationals, obviously we have amended the 2021 scheme to reflect the end of the transition period, and the distinct category will remain for individuals who have been excluded under the former immigration EEA regulations, but the new scheme also reflects that from January 2021, individuals, whether EEA or third-country nationals, may be deported from the UK under the Immigration Act 1971 and excluded by the Home Secretary exercising prerogative powers. Further to that, non-visa nationals who are excluded or who have been deported will be subject to refusals of authority to carry and should not arrive in the UK, but where they do, their details are available to Border Force officers and the e-gates.</p>
    <p pid="a1116.0/6">The noble Lord, Lord Paddick, asked how long before departure. It would be 24 hours before departure. He asked whether these details will be provided as passengers check in. Yes, information is provided for all routes ordinarily, but it can be on a route-specific basis if a new route opens and the carrier has different abilities.</p>
    <p pid="a1116.0/7">The authority to carry scheme has not relied on SIS II information and the updated scheme will be implemented 21 days from the sign-off of the SIs.</p>
    <p pid="a1116.0/8">As for the figures on the number and scale of fines, I believe I have already addressed both the scale of the fine and the number of fines. The maximum penalty has been £25,000 and the average is around £10,000, and they are determined using the calculation published in the guidance for carriers. I have already said that carriers are very positive about this. They welcome the scheme and do not in any way seek to undermine it.</p>
    <p pid="a1116.0/9">I think I have probably gone through all the points made by noble Lords. Where I have not, it is because I do not have an answer and I will get back to noble Lords in due course.</p>

Economic Partnership Agreement: Kenya

    <p pid="a1118.2/2">That this House takes note of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the one part, and the Republic of Kenya, a Member of the East African Community, of the other part, laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2021-12-17">17 December</phrase> 2020.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.2/3">Special attention drawn by the International Agreements Committee, 2nd Report.</p>
  </speech>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1118.3" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/12924" colnum="1118" time="17:01:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1118.3/1">My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the International Agreements Committee’s second report, which covers the economic partnership agreement between the United Kingdom and Kenya. As the committee’s chair I extend my thanks to the members of the committee for their important contribution to this report, as well as to the staff. I also thank the noble Lord the Minister for his constructive engagement with the committee, both publicly and in private, and for facilitating this debate.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/2">Before I turn to the contents of the report I will take a few moments to make some general comments on the scrutiny by Parliament of international agreements. The House will have heard me say before that international agreements—treaties—affect us all. They can affect important aspects of our lives: the economy, goods and services, our security and our rights. Scrutiny by Parliament must therefore be not an afterthought but an integral part of the overall treaty-making process. As we all know, at the moment Parliament’s role is limited and focused on the end of the process, when a treaty has already been signed.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/3">I have said before that I believe Parliament should have a role at an earlier stage: when the objectives for negotiations are set. This is particularly relevant for trade agreements, and it happens in other countries such as the United States, and in the European Union. So I welcome the two commitments that the Minister made in this House during last week’s debate on the Trade Bill. They were made in response to a Motion put forward by a member of the committee, the noble Lord, Lord Lansley, whom I thank for his efforts in this regard.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/4">I am pleased that the Government have agreed to facilitate a debate on draft negotiating objectives for trade agreements, subject to parliamentary time, if it is requested by the International Agreements Committee,  and that the Government will not ratify a trade agreement until a debate has been held, provided it has been requested by a relevant committee in good time.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/5">The subject matter of the report is the UK-Kenya Economic Partnership Agreement—EPA for short. It is, on the one hand, a standard rollover trade agreement that seeks to ensure continuity of trade relations after the Brexit transition period. It replicates the treaty arrangements between the EU and Kenya.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/6">On the other hand, however, it is not a straightforward rollover agreement. First, the underlying agreement—the EU agreement with the East African Community partner states, of which Kenya is a member—is not actually in effect. Instead, Kenya enjoys duty-free access to the EU through something called the EU’s market access regulation.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/7">Secondly, and most crucially, the underlying multilateral EU agreement has been turned into a bilateral one, even if states belonging to the East African Community can apply to join it later. In signing a bilateral agreement with the UK, Kenya has effectively followed a go-it-alone approach. There were clear incentives for the Kenyan Government to do so. As the only country within the EAC not classed as a least developed country, it does not qualify for zero import duties under the general scheme of preferences for least developed countries. As Kenya is a lower-middle income country, it can expect reduced rates of import duty on only some goods. Considering that the UK is among Kenya’s top five export markets, one can see why it could be considered to be in Kenya’s immediate interest to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the UK to avoid import tariffs.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/8">There are, however, issues and questions about what this agreement does to regional coherence. There are concerns that it could have disruptive political and economic consequences for the wider East African Community. For example, the EAC partner states have agreed to a common market protocol which commits them to co-ordinate trade relations among themselves and between the bloc and third parties. The UK EPA appears to undermine this obligation. Also, the EAC has been a customs union since 2005, applying zero customs duties on goods and services within the bloc and applying a common external tariff to imports from countries outside the EAC. The UK-Kenya agreement could undermine this arrangement, as Kenya would be applying a separate and more generous tariff regime for UK imports. While the committee acknowledges in its report that the UK-Kenya EPA could indeed have been the most efficient option for maintaining Kenya’s preferential access to the UK market, we would welcome an assessment from the Minister of the potential disruptive consequences for the EAC.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/9">We would also like to ask the Minister that, were similar concerns to emerge in future agreements, they would be more clearly spelled out in the explanatory materials. The Written Ministerial Statement made by the Minister in response to our report helpfully explains that the UK’s overall objective remains to secure a regional deal with the whole of the East African Community. It also acknowledges that some EAC members</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/10" class="indent">“were not ready to enter into negotiations with the United Kingdom”</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/11">at the time. The Statement concludes by saying that it is the Government’s intention that the EPA be a “stepping stone” to stronger regional integration. So I would welcome it if the Minister could specify what steps the Government are taking to make sure that regional integration remains a priority for the UK Government and is not undermined through the bilateral agreement with Kenya.</p>
    <p pid="a1118.3/12">Conscious of time, I will leave it here for now, having set out the two broad themes of parliamentary scrutiny on the one hand and the impact of the UK-Kenya agreement on regional cohesion on the other. I know that colleagues on the International Agreements Committee speaking this afternoon will reflect on other points of detail raised in the debate. I look forward to what I hope will be a constructive debate. In particular, I look forward to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord McDonald. I thank him for choosing this debate in which to make his maiden speech. I welcome him to the House. I worked with him in government and I remember being hosted by him when he was the ambassador to Israel a few years ago, and I am therefore very keen to hear what he has to say now. However, I am also keen to see the huge contribution that I am sure he will make to the House, given his considerable experience and expertise. I beg to move.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1120.0" speakername="Lord Oates" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25464" colnum="1120" time="17:07:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1120.0/1">My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith. I have the privilege of being a member of the International Agreements Committee, which he chairs so adeptly. I also look forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford. Although I have not met him before today, I have a strong connection to him because my nephew James worked for him and my father married him—I should stress that my father is a clergyman.</p>
    <p pid="a1120.0/2">I join the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, in welcoming some of the movement by the Government on the issues of scrutiny, in particular on what I believe has already been dubbed the “Grimstone rule”, by which the Government have agreed that where the IAC has requested a debate on a treaty, the Government will not ratify it before time has been provided for that debate. Some would say that that is the absolute basic minimum requirement that any self-respecting Parliament could accept, but it is welcome none the less.</p>
    <p pid="a1120.0/3">In the short time I have available, I will focus briefly on two things. The first is the impact on regional integration in east Africa of the decision by our Government to embark on a bilateral agreement with the Government of Kenya rather than pursuing an agreement with the East African Community as a whole. I understand, of course, as set out in our report, that Kenya had a particular issue, being the only country that was not classified as a least developed country. However, as paragraph 13 of the IAC report highlights, the Government have failed to explain adequately what other options they considered for ensuring continuity of trade with Kenya other than by concluding a bilateral EPA, which inevitably has caused huge concern to other EAC members. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to explain this in his response.</p>
    <p pid="a1120.0/4">The agreement causes serious difficulties in the region and appears to place Kenya in breach of its treaty obligations to the EAC. We know, of course, that the UK Government briefly toyed with the idea of breaching our own treaty obligations with the EU, but at least they had the sense to draw back from such action. It is regrettable that, by pursuing the approach they have, the Government have placed Kenya and the EAC in such a difficult position.</p>
    <p pid="a1120.0/5">Secondly, I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us more about the Government’s overall approach to trade agreements with developing countries. Many of us have been concerned about the approach that the EU took in the past to developing countries. The Minister may be aware of the APPG for Africa’s excellent report on the lessons learned from the EU EPAs with Africa; that report raises a number of issues, including the constraints that they place on development policy space for African countries. I hope that the Minister can address those points.</p>

    <p pid="a1121.0/1">My Lords, I welcome the EPA’s focus on development and the commitment to continue to provide duty-free and quota-free access to the UK market for Kenyan goods. This will assist Kenya in seeing the growth benefits from international trade, aided by the appointment of Theo Clarke MP as trade envoy to Kenya and programmes such as TradeMark East Africa, which help promote trade between our two countries.</p>
    <p pid="a1121.0/2">I appreciate the difficulties that there were in negotiating an EAC-wide agreement before Brexit. However, I share the concerns of the International Agreements Committee and civil society groups that the signing of individual EPAs could risk disruptive economic and political impacts and undermine some of the development objectives, particularly regional integration in east Africa. I would be grateful for my noble friend the Minister’s comments on that.</p>
    <p pid="a1121.0/3">I am speaking before the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford, whom I had the pleasure of working with at the FCDO towards the end of his lengthy and loyal service. I agree wholeheartedly with his remarks yesterday that the cutting of our international development budget—moving in the opposite direction to the rest of the G7—is a strategic and regrettable mistake. I look forward to his experienced contributions to this place on that and other international issues.</p>
    <p pid="a1121.0/4">This economic partnership and our broader relationship with Kenya—indeed, with the continent of Africa—is at risk due to the planned cut in international development. There are reports of our bilateral programmes in Kenya being cut by between 50% and 70%. Can my noble friend the Minister tell me what conversations his department has had with the FCDO about the impact of these cuts? Will the important trade programmes to which the Prime Minister recommitted last year at the UK-Africa Investment Summit—such as the successful TradeMark East Africa programme, which has a budget of $155 million up to 2023 in Kenya alone and has already allocated this funding to 36 projects—be fully protected? These projects are delivered in close partnership with the Government of Kenya, the EU, Ireland, Denmark,  Finland and the United States. Will we uphold our commitment to them? Has an impact assessment been made of how the cuts in Kenya will affect our trade relationship?</p>
    <p pid="a1121.0/5">Finally, does the Minister agree that one department trying to increase trade with Kenya while another undermines our bilateral relations and trade programmes through massive budget cuts is not exactly joined-up government?</p>

    <p pid="a1122.0/1">I welcome and call the next speaker, the noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford.</p>
  </speech>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1122.1" speakername="Lord McDonald of Salford" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25977" colnum="1122" time="17:13:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1122.1/1">I rise to address your Lordships’ House for the first time. I feel I should introduce myself. Noble Lords know my name and can guess that Salford is important to me. I was born and brought up there. Family is the centre of my life. Every day, I remember family members who are no longer here—today, my dad and my brother, Dominic, in particular.</p>
    <p pid="a1122.1/2">After completing school in Salford, I studied history at Cambridge. After graduation, I joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where I worked for 38 years. For five years, I was the Permanent Under-Secretary, which explains why international relations will be one of my main interests in your Lordships’ House.</p>
    <p pid="a1122.1/3">No matter what any of us thought about leaving the European Union, our shared objective now is to protect and promote the interests of the United Kingdom outside the EU. Part of that task is to replace trade agreements from which the UK benefited as an EU member. Time has been short. In future, it will be better when Parliament is consulted by the Government when framing objectives for trade negotiations.</p>
    <p pid="a1122.1/4">The economic partnership agreement with Kenya is one of the first wave of trade agreements. As a lower middle-income country in a customs union with least-developed countries, Kenya finds itself in a bind. All its neighbours enjoy duty- and quota-free access to the UK. For now, its neighbours are not interested in signing a trade agreement. Kenya’s horticultural exports are vital to its economy and the UK is one of its largest markets. To help our key partner, I believe we should not impose tariffs on Kenya’s flowers, fruits and vegetables. To achieve that in a way that is compatible with World Trade Organization rules, the agreement we are debating today is the best option available.</p>
    <p pid="a1122.1/5">To support the work of the UK overseas will be my main objective in your Lordships’ House, but I shall not confine myself to foreign affairs. My other interests are the environment and the governance of the UK—the union, the regions and the Civil Service. It is my honour to be the latest Foreign Office PUS to join your Lordships’ House; three of my distinguished predecessors are already noble Lords. My only regret in joining now is that I shall not be able to work with a fourth predecessor, the late Lord Wright of Richmond, but I think of him today and honour his memory, as his successor and son-in-law.</p>
    <p pid="a1122.1/6">Having spoken for the first time, I plan now to listen carefully before disturbing your Lordships again. Meanwhile, I thank your Lordships for making me feel young and naive for the last time in my life, and for listening to me today.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1123.0" speakername="Lord Kerr of Kinlochard" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13443" colnum="1123" time="17:17:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1123.0/1">What a pleasure it was to hear the noble Lord, Lord McDonald, and what a good foretaste of what he will bring to our debates. It is obviously a great pleasure to follow him. We have heard how well he manages suaviter in modo; I can assure the House that he is also pretty good at fortiter in re. He is quite tough: after all, he endured a couple of years working for me in Washington. He went on to hold very senior jobs across Whitehall, not just in the Foreign Office, and to be a distinguished ambassador in Israel and Germany. He may well have got the suaviter bit from Patrick, Lord Wright of Richmond, his father-in-law, who was so liked and is so much missed here in this House. Like Patrick, and like me, he served five years as Permanent Under-Secretary. His were more challenging times than mine. He brings us considerable wisdom and experience, and I welcome him very warmly to this House.</p>
    <p pid="a1123.0/2">I am very glad that we are having this little debate on the agreement with Kenya before it is ratified. Like the noble Lord, Lord Oates, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Grimstone, for his assurance on <phrase class="date" code="2021-02-23">23 February</phrase> on the Floor of the House that it would be inconceivable in future that we should not have a pre-ratification debate if such a debate were recommended by the committee of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith. I have long envied American negotiators their ability to argue, during a negotiation, that however admirable a suggestion from our side was, “It will never fly on the Hill.” Our negotiators now have a comparable weapon in their armoury.</p>
    <p pid="a1123.0/3">In the time allowed to me, I can make only two very brief points about the agreement itself. First, of course the cohesion of the East African Community matters and, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, said, the compatibility of this new agreement with Article 7 of its common market protocol is not at all clear, but I do not believe that in practice the agreement threatens the cohesion of the EAC. Under the agreement, tariff reductions by the Kenyan Government, which might create a perceived need for customs checks inside the EAC, will start only seven years ahead. By then, I would hope that all five other members of the EAC would have acceded to this agreement or a comparable, improved version of it. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that that is indeed the Government’s aim.</p>
    <p pid="a1123.0/4">Secondly, the IAC report drew particular attention to the scrutiny of amendments to agreements. It is important, if we are to avoid future disputes, to devise clear criteria for determining when an amendment—or, indeed, a memorandum of understanding, an exchange of letters or an agreed minute—is of sufficient weight to trigger CRaG scrutiny. I am encouraged by the sympathetic hearing that the noble Lord, Lord Grimstone, has so far given to the concept of a criteria-based approach, and I urge him not to weary in well doing.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1124.0" speakername="Lord Boateng" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10052" colnum="1124" time="17:21:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1124.0/1">My Lords, it is a pleasure to speak in the maiden debate of the noble Lord, Lord McDonald. I had the honour of serving with him as a Minister and then as a colleague. He may be young compared to many of us, but he was never naive—at least not in my experience.</p>
    <p pid="a1124.0/2">I welcome the opportunity to have this debate and commend the work of my noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith and his committee in giving this agreement much-needed scrutiny. I particularly support the call, and concerns expressed within it, for the implications of this agreement for economic regional integration. Successive Governments of all political hues have long supported regional economic integration in Africa as one of the best means of lifting people out of poverty. It would be a tragedy if these agreements—this is the first of a number—were to undermine the real progress that has been made in the development and economic integration of the regions of Africa, not least as this is the first year of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. This free trade agreement creates the largest global free trade area in the world by country number, aims to be a model of cross-border co-operation—something that DfID, as it was, and the current department have long championed—and, importantly, offers a real prospect for a continent currently facing a pandemic that has caused it up to $79 billion in output losses in 2020 alone. Africa has never needed economic integration more than now. The World Bank estimates that the African Continental Free Trade Agreement will boost regional income by 7%, or $450 billion, speed up wage growth for women and lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty by 2035.</p>
    <p pid="a1124.0/3">If regional integration does not come to pass on the continent, we face the real prospect of holding it back and increasing still further the number of people who will fall into poverty as a result of Covid. I therefore urge the Minister to respond positively to the request in the report that the Government should provide an assessment of the risks posed by the agreement to the East African Community Customs Union, as well as an assessment of the implications of any bilateral agreement for regional integration in East Africa. This is important today, since Ghana has signed—in the Locarno room—a post-Brexit trade agreement with the UK. I commend the hard work of Ministers on both sides for all they have done in that regard. If that hard work is to be turned into benefits for farmers, young entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized businesses, it requires that this report and its implications are taken seriously by the Government so that, when we come to consider Ghana’s free trade agreement with the UK, it will enhance rather than damage regional integration.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1124.1" speakername="Lord McNally" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13129" colnum="1124" time="17:26:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1124.1/1">My Lords, there are times when debates in this House make one feel very old. Between 1974 and 1979 I was a special adviser to Jim Callaghan, working closely with the much-missed Lord Wright of Richmond, the father-in-law of our new Peer. It is also worth remembering that at the time the bright, young Private Secretary to the Permanent Under-Secretary, Sir Tommy Brimelow, was the noble  Lord, Lord Kerr. There is one last thought on which the noble Lord, Lord McDonald, might ponder: when Tommy Brimelow came into the House, he joined the Labour Benches. The noble Lord does have a choice.</p>
    <p pid="a1124.1/2">Kenya is important, not only as a trading partner, as has already been pointed out, but as a country in its own right. It is a member of the UN Security Council and a senior member of the African Union. We have already heard about its membership of the East African Community and, of course, it is a key member of the Commonwealth. It is important that the relationship is endorsed and supported by this House.</p>
    <p pid="a1124.1/3">Some real worries have already been expressed in this debate. In seeking the new bilateral treaties, the UK must not become a disruptor of existing partnerships, as the noble Lord, Lord Boateng, warned us, which are so important to development in Africa. Although, like my noble friend Lord Oates, I accept that the concessions about parliamentary scrutiny are the basic, minimum requirement, if the Government are sincere in their pledge about bringing sovereignty back not to the Executive but to Parliament, they should look at radical reform of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. That would show their real intention to give Parliament the kind of scrutiny that trade and other international relations treaties deserve. We must make sure that they are seen in the wider context of regional stability, our ambitions for climate change targets, development goals and support for human rights, as well as squeezing bribery and corruption out of trade altogether. That is what we want to hear from the Government.</p>
    <p pid="a1124.1/4">I look forward to the Minister’s reply. Again, I welcome the noble Lord, Lord McDonald, to the House and look forward to his future contributions.</p>

    <p pid="a1125.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, for introducing this debate. Along with other noble Lords, I most heartily congratulate the noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford, on his entertaining maiden speech. Your Lordships’ House will gain a great deal from his experience and perspectives as the global Britain programme accelerates.</p>
    <p pid="a1125.0/2">During the last few weeks of the implementation—or transition—period, all eyes were on the discussions with the EU, led by my noble friend Lord Frost. I trust that we are likely to see rather more of him in your Lordships’ House in future. He successfully concluded the trade and co-operation agreement with the EU on Christmas Eve, a wonderful Christmas present for the British people.</p>
    <p pid="a1125.0/3">Little attention has been given to the impressive performance of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Trade and her team in sorting out a large number of continuity free trade agreements during December. As of now, the UK has secured continuity or enhanced continuity trade agreements with almost all the 70 countries with which we had previously signed up to free trade agreements as members of the EU. Last month it was announced that we have applied to join the CPTPP, a free trading area with a combined GDP of £9 trillion. This is very exciting and enormously significant for global Britain.</p>
    <p pid="a1125.0/4">It is also to be celebrated that we have now signed up to seven free trade agreements covering 14 African countries. Important among those agreements to which we signed up in December was that with Kenya. In terms of volume of traded goods, it was perhaps not the most important, but in terms of geostrategic significance I submit that it was rather more important. Some observers have said that the agreement may have a negative effect on economic integration among the members of the East African Community. However, under Article 143 of the agreement, the other members of the EAC are entitled to make an accession request to the UK-Kenya EPA Council.</p>
    <p pid="a1125.0/5">The International Agreements Committee of your Lordships’ House asked why the Government did not transition the market access regulation into UK law. It seems clear that the reason no other partner state of the EAC chose to ratify the EU-EAC EPA is that they could enjoy duty-free and quota-free access through the EU’s market access regulation. Beyond this, all the other partner states had an additional incentive not to ratify the agreement, as they are least developed countries and, as such, already benefit from duty-free, quota-free access under the EU’s generalised scheme of preferences LDC framework.</p>
    <p pid="a1125.0/6">Kenya has seen sustained growth for over a decade, rooted in fundamental reforms which have made the Kenyan economy competitive and increased its attractiveness to international investment. I welcome this agreement.</p>

    <p pid="a1126.0/1">My Lords, I too welcome the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford, and in doing so express my sadness that his late father-in-law, Lord Wright of Richmond, was not here to see him make it. I worked once for someone who said he was a founder member of the son-in-law club. He was a former Leader of this House, Lord Soames, and his father-in-law was Winston Churchill, of course. He always used to say, “the son- in-law also rises.”</p>
    <p pid="a1126.0/2">In so far as the UK-Kenya agreement we are debating is one of the category that the Government call continuity agreements—perhaps more clearly described as rollover agreements of the terms which already existed between the UK and Kenya when we were a member of the EU or in transition out of it—there is probably no need to go into too much detail, which is fortunate since, as usual, we have no time to do so.</p>
    <p pid="a1126.0/3">Perhaps when the Minister replies to the debate he can identify any elements in the agreement which provide better access to our market than Kenyan exporters already had, or provide our exporters of goods or services with better access to the Kenyan market than they already had. What we are talking about, therefore, is running to stand still. I am not denigrating that; it is certainly better than nothing and better than regressing to straightforward third-country treatment of each other. But it is still light years removed from what was promised by the promoters of Brexit once we had shaken off what they described as the “shackles” of EU membership.</p>
    <p pid="a1126.0/4">That brings me to a wider point, which was raised forcefully in the report of your Lordships’ International Relations and Defence Committee on the UK’s relations  with sub-Saharan Africa—a report published last July and still languishing undebated. It is now nearing five years since the Department for International Trade was set up in the aftermath of the 2016 referendum to establish the outlines of the UK’s new independent trade policy, yet to this day not a word has been revealed about what that policy should be towards Africa —a substantial proportion of the world’s population, containing many rapidly growing markets. Not one word has been said about those African countries’ improved access to our market, which must surely be an integral part of any serious partnership between the UK and Africa.</p>
    <p pid="a1126.0/5">This failure to identify and to promote the countries of Africa as a priority part of our new trade policy is surely a lamentable one which must be remedied. However, the Government’s written replies to our report’s recommendations—two attempts were needed—were vapid and imprecise, and contained no sense of urgency. Clearly, pursuit of the mirage of a UK-US agreement and that of an agreement with the Pacific grouping, with seven of whose 11 members we already have free trade agreements, were crowding out any consideration of Africa. I hope that the Minister can say that this will not continue to be the case and give us chapter and verse on how that lacuna will be filled, at the latest when the report on sub-Saharan Africa is finally debated.</p>

    <p pid="a1127.1/1">It has happened many times before; not to worry.</p>
    <p pid="a1127.1/2">My Lords, the maiden speech by the noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford, was one of the finest.</p>
    <p pid="a1127.1/3">The Kenyan agreement should become a beacon of best practice, promoting inclusion, sustainability and green growth, and, importantly, should be based around delivering African priorities. However, the UK’s recent push to sign continuity agreements with African states has drawn criticism for being overly focused on the UK’s needs and not those of the continent. There is an excellent opportunity to reset the trade relationship with Africa and seek an agreement that centres on the priorities of that continent: the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, which aims to boost intra-African trade. This would tie in well with Commonwealth objectives to boost intra-Commonwealth trade, a significant proportion of which should be in Africa, a point borne out in Nairobi at the Commonwealth summit hosted by the Secretary-General, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland.</p>
    <p pid="a1127.1/4">However, as a broader strategy of approach, emphasis should not be just on anglophone Africa. The UK’s ambition to be the lead investor in Africa should be seen within the context of opportunities in francophone and lusophone countries, and the Hispanic Equatorial Guinea. Being an international centre for mobile technology, digital trade ought to be prominent and include financial services. The UK should be seeking to agree a modern digital trade corridor, on par with  those agreed with Japan and Singapore, with free movement of money, data supporting inward investments services and trade in goods.</p>
    <p pid="a1127.1/5">Notwithstanding a round of development cuts, we should be seeking to better utilise our diminishing funds to build resilience and capabilities in key areas such as digital connectivity, climate, health and skills. I conclude by saying that we should be mindful too of UK-EU-Africa supply chains—the east African flower trade being a case in point, as has already been referred to. This Kenya agreement should strengthen these things and not have the negative effect of disrupting and undermining them; although, as an aside, I have long been a proponent of the establishment of greater east-west transport corridors.</p>

    <p pid="a1128.0/1">I thank the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley. I will not forget again. I now call the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft.</p>
  </speech>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1128.1" speakername="Baroness Wheatcroft" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25031" colnum="1128" time="17:38:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1128.1/1">My Lords, I commend the impressive maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford, and welcome that he is clearly intent on being an active Member of this House. I thank the Minister for giving us the Grimstone rule, to which reference has already been made. It is  a small concession to parliamentary democracy, but a welcome one.</p>
    <p pid="a1128.1/2">This agreement demonstrates why Parliament needs to be involved in formulating these agreements. I love Kenya and have spent many happy times there. It is a country rich in natural resources, but it has a massive problem, which I wish to concentrate on today: corruption. It ranks 124th in Transparency International’s index of 180 countries.</p>
    <p pid="a1128.1/3">When Kenya’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission was launched in 2016, its director said that Kenya was losing a third of its state budget—around $7 billion a year—to corruption. Sadly, things have not improved since then. A succession of scandals in public procurement have been exposed, year after year. Some have involved massive contracts and some just a consistent pattern of graft. Such corruption deprives the people of the wealth that they could be enjoying and that Kenya, without corruption, would be well placed to deliver. Currently, there are investigations into alleged corruption over Covid-related contracts—although that is of course not unique to Kenya.</p>
    <p pid="a1128.1/4">So could we not have been more ambitious in pushing Kenya towards transparency in public procurement contracts? The agreement states that the parties will aim to conclude negotiations on transparency in public procurement within five years. I ask the Minister: why did we not push for something more demanding on this vital issue?</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1128.2" speakername="Earl of Sandwich" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13633" colnum="1128" time="17:41:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1128.2/1">My Lords, as a rollover agreement, the UK-Kenya EPA has had rather a bumpy ride through Parliament, both here and in Kenya. This stems mainly from the cavalier treatment of the other EAC members, which are assumed to go along with it since they already benefit from LDC and EBA preferences.</p>
    <p pid="a1128.2/2">Like other members of the IAC, I have been especially concerned about whether any countries were consulted as individual nations, as well as via the EAC itself. Nairobi has always had the monopoly of communications, as well as of trade, in east Africa; that is a fact of life. But Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and even South Sudan, and the new applicants DRC and Somalia, all have strong interests in trading with the UK. They do not want any disruption. Even in Nairobi, several MPs complained that their Government had failed to consult fully with their own stakeholders on the agreement, with the result that parliamentary debate was held up and the deadline for ratification missed.</p>
    <p pid="a1128.2/3">There were some deep-seated civil society and farming concerns that the EPA, like its EU-ACP predecessor, tended to treat Kenya as a supplier of raw materials and primary products, rather than encouraging its SMEs and businesses to develop its manufacturing base. For some, this recalls the UK’s neo-colonial links with Africa and is still a long way short of the vision of fair and sustainable trade that helps the poor. The noble Lord, Lord Boateng, made powerful points on that as well.</p>
    <p pid="a1128.2/4">There is a real risk that the EPA could destabilise the EAC itself by negotiating with only Kenya and the bloc rather than with individual members. The community was founded in 1999 and is still the strongest regional association in Africa. It held its 21st summit last weekend. It has achieved a degree of integration, but its members still control their own foreign policy. The Minister has claimed that the DIT kept in touch with individual states, but perhaps he could give details today. The fact that they have been formally invited to join the agreement after the event hardly makes a difference if they each have different policy objectives.</p>
    <p pid="a1128.2/5">I do not blame Brexit for all this directly, but I can point a finger at the last-minute arrangements devised by the Government to patch up a lot of these important trade agreements. The Minister might argue that this was a cunning plan to ensure that the agreement went through just in time, but most people would think, and perhaps Ministers would admit, that it was a messy consequence of doing things in too much of a hurry.</p>
    <p pid="a1128.2/6">I welcome the noble Lord, Lord McDonald, to our Cross Benches, and thank him for his unambiguous support for our aid programme.</p>
  </speech>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1129.0" speakername="Lord Purvis of Tweed" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/14080" colnum="1129" time="17:45:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1129.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the committee for its Motion allowing us to debate this agreement and for its work under the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith. I am also grateful for the opportunity to have heard the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord McDonald, who gave evidence to the committee that I sat on in this House. He should feel fully liberated after 38 years. We have the evidence of his two amigos as former Permanent Secretaries who are hardly inhibited in providing their views to the House—so we look forward to the noble Lord doing exactly the same, because he will have much to offer. He will find, as I have over the seven years I have been here, that this House is great for making you feel perpetually young.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/2">I welcome this first application of the Grimstone rule—that we will not ratify agreements before they have been debated if a committee has asked for that  debate to take place. I welcome the fact that the Government has ensured that this debate has indeed taken place, as my noble friend Lord Oates highlighted in his remarks. He also referred to the tension there now is within the EAC over the moves to have a bilateral agreement, and I will refer to that.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/3">We know that the European EPA has not yet been ratified by all members of the EAC, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, said. But, importantly, he highlighted that there are other elements of preferential relationships, and the partnership mechanisms of Aid for Trade and economic development in that EPA, for which we have not provided any continuity with Kenya. Now that this is the mechanism which the Government have said that other countries will be invited to accede to, they will not be acceding to any continuity that had been in existence in the European agreement.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/4">So what is the Government’s intention? Is this an agreement which other countries will be invited to accede to? Or, if a country chooses to enter into an agreement with the UK, within the aegis of the EAC, will we reopen negotiations with those other countries to afford them all of the different partnership and trade for development policies? The MoU that accompanies the agreement will give Kenya and the UK a much greater say than other countries in the EAC acceding to this agreement. It is almost insulting to other members of that community to say that if they wish to have the same arrangements with the UK that they had previously within the EU, they will have to join this agreement. Why was the previously discussed bridging mechanism for Kenya rejected? This was not clear in the Government’s evidence to the committee.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/5">Like the noble Lord, Lord Boateng, I am pleased that the final agreement for Ghana has now been agreed, after two months of applying tariffs to Ghanaian products. As we have heard, the concern of farmers and the rural community in Kenya, who are now seeking legal remedy from their own Government over this agreement, shows that there are deep consequences of our arrangements with these two countries.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/6">With regard to the Kenya agreement, the wider partnership elements are the essence of these agreements. EPAs are not simply tariff agreements or FTAs; they are genuinely partnership agreements—that is the essence of them. Therefore, we need to look at the wider, non-tariff areas of relationships, deliberately framed not to be purely about tariff measures for middle-income countries, or codifying the Everything But Arms approach for other countries in the different categories.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/7">As the noble Baroness, Lady Sugg, said in her very informed and powerful contribution on development support, this is not a continuity agreement. In Annexe 3A of the EU’s Aid for Trade agreement there is a matrix of 23 pages of costed, specified projects for increasing trade, competition and finance from the European Union through its European Development Fund and the members of the EAC and Kenya.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/8">This annexe has been removed from the UK agreement, with no replacement. Indeed, the section on development co-operation in the Government’s report has two paragraphs and leads with what I find are chilling words. Paragraph 57 starts—the noble Lord, Lord McDonald, will have to forgive me, but this is perfect Civil Service speak—with the words:</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/9" class="indent">“In line with the different approaches of Britain and the EU to programming for development cooperation”.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/10">What does that mean? What are “different approaches” to programming for development co-operation? It means, by the last sentence, that while parts of this agreement reflect the ambitions of the parties, they</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/11" class="indent">“do not create any obligations on us to provide financial or non-financial support in specific areas.”</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/12">So aid for trade and development support have been stripped out entirely from this agreement.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/13">None of the commitments is binding in Parts III to V. In Part V, the 27 articles have the rider, of course, that there will be no financial commitment or obligations. Technically, under this agreement, which we are being asked to ratify, there is no commitment for a single pound in facilitating aid for trade or trade for development support. Can the Minister clarify what is the aid for trade development support with this agreement? Let me be clear what it is. It relates to food standards and upgrading laboratories. It is connected to all of the areas where we would seek to facilitate UK trade to develop even further. This is sending a very strong negative message.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/14">This leads me to the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Sugg, mentioned with regards to TradeMark East Africa, which has been highlighted by respective Governments over the past decade as a very significant success for the UK. Our support for TradeMark East Africa facilitates $100 million to the benefit of UK businesses, making trade easier and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, highlighted, tackling corruption and bureaucracy, reducing trade costs by 30%, increasing competition, improving transport corridors for trade, and increasing jobs and prosperity. But TradeMark East Africa now has a sword hanging over it. It has already been asked to make 20% cuts last year by the FCDO, reducing its staff to a four-day week, and now it could see a cut of 50% of its work, which in effect would make it inoperable. You can only cut programmes so far before they are unable to be delivered. This is a flagship project. Such a cut could create significant long-term reputational damage for the UK, putting at risk longer-term projects that we have secured with our partners.</p>
    <p pid="a1129.0/15">The final point I would like to make to the Minister is that it is not too late to reverse the trajectory. If we are to have better digitisation, anti-corruption measures, better procedures, better standards, policy development and support for women traders, which should be the essence of these EPAs, we cannot see cuts to TradeMark for East Africa. It would be inconsistent with the wider approach and inconsistent with what we are told should be an Africa strategy in the fastest growing, and what is likely to be the biggest, trading area in the world. It is not too late. I hope the Government will persuade the Secretary of State to change course.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2021-03-02a.1131.0" speakername="Lord Collins of Highbury" type="Start Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25048" colnum="1131" time="17:54:00" url="">
    <p pid="a1131.0/1">My Lords, let me start by echoing the remarks of other noble Lords in welcoming the noble Lord, Lord McDonald. He showed remarkable ability in being able to say so much in such a short period of time. I hope he will continue with that record.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/2">I also echo the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Sugg, which complemented those of the noble Lord, Lord McDonald, on support for the Government’s commitment to ODA. I saw first hand last year the in-country programmes in Kenya, in particular on nutrition and agriculture, which is what this agreement could particularly impact, and the diversity of agriculture which is necessary to ensure proper nutrition. One of the problems with the focus on trade is that often those agricultural products that we import are not delivering for the people of Kenya in the way that they should in terms of nutrition. I hope that we will return to that subject later on.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/3">This continuity agreement is one of 10 that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2021-01-01">1 January</phrase>, and it is the only one that has been subject to any form of debate in either House. This illustrates how the CRaG process is totally inadequate in guaranteeing proper parliamentary scrutiny of new trade deals before they come into effect. Like other noble Lords, I welcome the changes that were made in the Trade Bill; I understand that they will now be called the “Grimstone protocols”, which is great news, as I can keep repeating that name.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/4">The Minister may well say that this is just a rollover agreement but, as we have heard in this debate and as the analysis by the International Agreements Committee shows, this is not the case. There should have been a proper discussion before this deal came into effect, given its implications for the rest of the East African Community. As the noble Lord, Lord Oates, highlighted, I hope the Minister will respond in full to the committee’s request to explain what other options were considered for ensuring continuity of trading arrangements with Kenya, and why they were not pursued. In particular, what representations were made by the other EAC members and stakeholders, and how have the Government sought to evaluate those and address their concerns?</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/5">As the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, noted, we know that Kenya’s Parliament failed in December to ratify the trade agreement with the UK, calling for a supplementary report on the economic partnership agreement. Last week, the Kenya Small Scale Farmers Forum sued the Kenyan Government, arguing that the process of the deal’s ratification was extremely flawed as no public participation was conducted by the Kenyan Government before the document was proposed in the Kenyan Parliament. In a statement, the farmers said that</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/6" class="indent">“an open market with heavily subsidized tariffs for the UK farm products like chicken, pigs and maize”</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/7">would have</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/8" class="indent">“the dangerous potential to destroy local production of the very same products”.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/9">We had a debate on the EU EPA in this House, in November 2016, when all these issues were raised in relation to the development project and, in particular, the question of how we would deliver on the 2030 agenda to build sustainable development.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/10">One other issue I want to raise, in addition to those identified by the committee, and which I focused on during debate on the Trade Bill, is human rights provisions in the Kenya deal. We have all heard the mantra of Ministers that these agreements simply maintain the status quo from the EU agreements that  came before them. In some cases that is certainly true; for example, the agreement with the Ivory Coast signed by the Government in November 2020 and published in sufficient time for it to receive the full 21 sitting days of parliamentary scrutiny before taking effect on <phrase class="date" code="2021-01-01">1 January</phrase>. Annexe 3 to that agreement replicates the effect and language of the EU’s Cotonou Agreement with the African, Caribbean and Pacific states, committing both parties to uphold human rights and the rule of law as an essential element of the agreement, spelling out the process and consequences that would follow any violation of that commitment. The Kenya agreement contains the same Annexe 3 as that of the Ivory Coast but removes the entire section dealing with the consequences of any violations of the human rights commitments. There is no explanation as to why; I hope the Minister will be able to explain that tonight.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/11">I have argued in this House that we should use continuity agreements to strengthen the provisions in trade agreements relating to human rights—but here, in the Kenya agreement, there is a clear example of where the Government have actually done the opposite. One reason that this matters is that, as other noble Lords have pointed out, other East African Community countries will be able to join the EPA—countries that, according to Amnesty International, have a clear poor human rights record. We should focus on the implications of that.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/12">Regional press reports this week say that Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda have demanded the extension of the negotiation period by one year so that they can sign the agreement as a bloc. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us exactly what the implications of that are.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/13">Finally, as the Minister doubtless knows, Africa is home to 30 of the world’s 40 most climate-vulnerable countries, and Kenya ranks 152 out of 181, with an increasing prevalence of droughts and floods. Where once the rains marked the predictable changing of the seasons and could be relied on by smallholder farmers for their livelihoods, climate change and plagues of locusts are wreaking deadly havoc.</p>
    <p pid="a1131.0/14">However, in the hustle and bustle of Nairobi, Kenya has hope for a bright and green future, planning a new sovereign green bond. The UK’s development budget has been very actively involved in encouraging Kenya’s green transition—so what assurance can the Minister give that the UK’s support for Kenya’s climate ambitions will be protected from the spending cuts that the Chancellor has imposed on this vital work?</p>

    <p pid="a1133.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, for tabling this debate, and I welcome the opportunity for an informed discussion of the UK-Kenya Economic Partnership Agreement and the Government’s wider approach to securing continuity in our trading relationships with the whole of the East African Community. Of course, this work is so important to UK and east African citizens and businesses alike. In view of the time constraints, I will restrict my comments to the substance of the debate.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/2">It is a great pleasure to see parliamentary scrutiny in action in this debate, living up to the commitments that we made during the progress of the Trade Bill—in particular, following what I like to think of as the “Purvis convention” in the way that we approach these matters. I thank all those who have contributed to this debate, and I will try to respond to the many insightful and well-informed points that have been raised. In particular, the expertise and commitment of the IAC members never fail to inspire me. If I do not fully respond to all the points, I will of course write to noble Lords after the debate.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/3">What a pleasure it is to have a noble Lord choose this debate as the occasion for his maiden speech. The noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford, made an observant, judicious and eloquent speech, befitting his nearly 40 years of illustrious service to this country’s diplomacy at the highest levels. I know I speak on behalf of all noble Lords in saying that we not only welcome his presence but eagerly anticipate his future contributions, to the advantage of the quality and expertise of this House’s proceedings.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/4">I also thank the House of Lords International Agreements Committee and its officials for the detailed examination of our continuity agreements, as set out in its Scrutiny of International Agreements report. In responding, I will cover three main points: the UK’s approach to trade continuity with Kenya, our ambitions for a regional deal with the whole of the EAC, and our approach to the ratification of this agreement.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/5">First, as I know this was a matter of concern to a number of noble Lords, I reiterate the UK’s objective of achieving a regional trade agreement with the whole of the EAC. We remain absolutely committed to building a strong trading relationship with the whole EAC that will create jobs and prosperity in east Africa. It is very much our intention that the agreement we have signed with Kenya is a stepping-stone towards even stronger regional integration in future.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/6">Let me give a little of the background to how we ended up where we are today. Back in January 2020, the former Minister for Trade Policy wrote to the EAC’s secretary-general to reinforce the UK’s ambition to work in partnership with the EAC secretariat to build a strong trading relationship that will create jobs and prosperity in east Africa. In so doing, he proposed a meeting in February 2020 between the UK and representatives from the secretariat and all partner states to find a way to replicate the effects of the EU’s current trading arrangements between the UK and the EAC, and to avoid any disruption in our existing trade with the EAC partner states.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/7">We have continued since that date to engage with the secretariat and partner states, but during these discussions the EAC informed us that some partner states were unable to begin negotiations with the UK because of some domestic preoccupations. However, they understood the need to maintain trade continuity and provide certainty for businesses and citizens in all partner states as we approached the end of the transition period. It was therefore on this basis that the UK and Kenya decided to negotiate this agreement, ensuring that our discussions were open to all EAC partner   states to join. The fact is that no partner state chose to join these discussions, but I reassure noble Lords that we have left the door firmly open.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/8">In accordance with article 143 of the agreement, any state that is a contracting party to the Treaty for the Establishment of the East African Community is able to accede to this agreement in future. Indeed—some news hot off the press—noble Lords may have seen that on Saturday the EAC Heads of State held their annual summit. One of the things they considered was participation in trade agreements. The Heads of State provided approval to an approach enabling some partner states to proceed to implement the EU’s agreement with the EAC ahead of others.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/9">I am happy that this pragmatic approach by the Heads of State is exactly in keeping with the approach that we have taken in our EPA, and reassured that such a style of approach has now been approved at the EAC Heads of State level. If that is what the Heads of State have decided, I gently say: is it right for us to question this approach? I hope this will put at rest the mind of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, and those of other noble Lords if they feel that we have somehow been a disruptive force in the EAC in these matters. The noble Lord, Lord Boateng, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, were also concerned about this point.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/10">The agreement we have secured will ensure that companies operating in Kenya, including British businesses, can continue to benefit from duty-free quota access to the UK market for a range of important products, including vegetables and cut flowers. It will support jobs and economic development in Kenya and avoid possible disruption to UK businesses such as florists, which will be able to maintain tariff-free supply routes for Kenya’s high-quality flowers. It will also benefit many of the approximately 2,500 UK businesses exporting goods to Kenya each year, including many UK suppliers of machinery, electronics and technical equipment, where continued tariff-free access will be guaranteed.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/11">I turn to the UK’s approach to ensuring trade continuity with Kenya in response to the committee’s request for further detail on the options considered. As one of the largest economies in east Africa, Kenya is of course an important trading partner for the UK. However, as the only EAC partner state that is not a least-developed country, it faced the imposition of new tariffs if we had been unable to secure a deal at the end of the transition period. Kenya faced reverting to less preferential trading arrangements under the UK’s generalised scheme of preferences. Without a deal in place, assuming that the current patterns of trade remain unchanged in future, the annual increase in duties on our imports from Kenya was estimated to be around £10.5 million in 2021. In contrast, as least-developed countries—and this is the important point—all other EAC partner states’ duty-free, quota-free access to the UK was guaranteed under the GSP.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/12">In its report, the committee asked the Government to explain why the UK had decided not to replicate the EU’s market access regulation. The agreement that we have signed allows for the effects of that regulation to be replicated in all material respects with regard to  Kenya. Providing permanent duty-free, quota-free access for Kenyan exports benefits UK-Kenyan trade, which was worth £1.4 billion in 2019. The agreement, taken together with the GSP, ensures that trade continuity is guaranteed for all EAC partner states.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/13">While the UK had proposed a no-deal transitional protection measure to Kenya in 2019, that had been developed only to provide an additional 18 months to conclude trade negotiations with certain partners who faced the imposition of new tariffs in the event of a no-deal EU exit. However, as the withdrawal agreement reached between the UK and the EU in October 2019 included an 11-month transition period until December 2020, that gave us the additional time that we needed to conclude outstanding negotiations. The no-deal transitional protection measure then became no longer appropriate.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/14">I turn to the Government’s approach to the ratification of the agreement. In my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2021-02-09">9 February</phrase> 2021, I outlined the steps taken by the Government in accordance with the statutory process for laying agreements under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. The Government believe that the explanatory materials published alongside the agreement on <phrase class="date" code="2021-12-17">17 December</phrase> were sufficient and we therefore made the decision not to extend CRaG, which concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2021-02-10">10 February</phrase>. However, I can confirm—and this was absolutely the right thing to do, in accordance with the commitments that I made from this very Dispatch Box during the passage of the Trade Bill—that the Government have not yet ratified the agreement, which we have delayed deliberately until after today’s debate in order to ensure that Parliament has had the opportunity to effectively scrutinise the text.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/15">The UK-Kenya Economic Partnership Agreement provides stability and certainty for UK and Kenyan businesses alike. It guarantees permanent duty-free, quota-free access to UK markets for one of the largest economies in the region. Without it, Kenya would have been left behind through no fault of its own while the other partner states continued to benefit from duty-free, quota-free access to UK markets. That unfairness was an unacceptable outcome for the UK. However, I reiterate that the agreement does not prejudice our approach towards the other EAC partner states. I confirm to noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, that we remain ambitious in our desire to expand the agreement in future, and we have ensured that the agreement contains a clear process for accession.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/16">Before I conclude, I will deal with a point made by my noble friend Lady Sugg and the noble Lord, Lord Purvis. I reassure noble Lords, with regard to the effect of the funding of previous ODA programmes, that trade and economic development—and building future trade and investment partners, including through helping countries to trade—is one of seven ODA priorities. No final decisions have been made on  budgets or allocations to individual programmes, but I am happy to reassure noble Lords that we intend to ensure that TradeMark East Africa can continue its important work in promoting trade to east Africa. I will write to the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, and send copies to the committee and the Library, on his point about the differences between this report and the EU report, and his points about the MoU.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/17">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, raised an important point about human rights. I hope I can reassure the noble Lord: Annex III of the UK’s economic partnership agreement with Kenya replicates language from the Cotonou agreement, and the effect of the Cotonou references to the EU’s economic partnership agreement with the East African Community will make sure that respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance, which are so important to all in this House, are made essential and fundamental elements of the agreement.</p>
    <p pid="a1133.0/18">In conclusion, therefore, I reiterate my thanks to the committee for its examination of this agreement—which, I repeat, has not yet been ratified—and I respect the committee’s desire for further time, which we have granted today, to enable full scrutiny of its provisions. Our ambition for this agreement was to ensure continuity for Kenya, and I like to feel that we have achieved that ambition.</p>

    <p pid="a1137.0/1">My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate. It has been very valuable, and although noble Lords had only a short time for their contributions, those have all  been significant. I too congratulate the noble Lord, Lord McDonald of Salford, on his maiden speech, which was, as anticipated, eloquent and impressive.</p>
    <p pid="a1137.0/2">I welcome the Minister’s assurances that this was not intended in any way to disrupt the arrangements for the rest of Africa. I thank him for his explanation. We will watch what is said: we will watch closely to see if other countries accede, as he has explained is now possible, and we will look at that closely.</p>
    <p pid="a1137.0/3">The other issue raised by noble Lords is parliamentary scrutiny. That is important to the International Agreements Committee, as I have said. Whether it is the Purvis protocol, the Grimstone rule or even Lansley’s law, we are pleased with the changes that are taking place: we are edging towards greater parliamentary scrutiny, which is important because we should not be just paying lip-service to it. We will continue to watch that.</p>
    <p pid="a1137.0/4">I thank the Minister for what he said about not ratifying. The department could perhaps have said that it would extend the time, but I suppose the effect has been the same. With that, I beg to move.</p>
    <p pid="a1137.0/5" class="italic">Motion agreed.</p>
    <p pid="a1137.0/6" class="italic">House adjourned at 6.20 pm.</p>
