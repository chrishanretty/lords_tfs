    <p pid="a1.2/1">My Lords, it not being convenient for Her Majesty personally to be present here this day, she has been pleased to cause a Commission under the Great Seal to be prepared in order to the holding of this Parliament.</p>
    <p pid="a1.2/2" class="italic">When the Commons arrived at the Bar:</p>
    <p pid="a1.2/3">My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, we are commanded by Her Majesty to let you know that, it not being convenient for her to be present here this day in her Royal Person, she hath thought fit, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal, to empower several Lords therein named to do all things in Her Majesty’s name, which are to be done on Her Majesty’s part in this Parliament as, by the Letters Patent, will more fully appear.</p>
    <p pid="a1.2/4" class="italic">When the Commission had been read at the Table:</p>
    <p pid="a1.2/5">My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, we have it in command from Her Majesty to let you know that, as soon as the Members of both Houses shall be sworn, the causes of Her Majesty calling this Parliament will be declared to you; and, it being necessary that a Speaker of the House of Commons should be first chosen, it is Her Majesty’s pleasure that you, Members of the House of Commons, repair to the place where you are to sit, and there proceed to the choice of some proper person to be your Speaker, and that you present such person whom you shall so choose here for Her Majesty’s Royal Approbation.</p>
    <p pid="a1.2/6" class="italic">The Commons then withdrew.</p>

Oaths and Affirmations

    <p pid="a1.4/1">My Lords, it may be convenient if I make a brief statement about the process for taking the oath and affirming today. After I have taken the oath, the most reverend Primates the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the party leaders, and the Convenor of the Cross Benches will then take the oath, followed by the Senior Deputy Speaker. The other Front-Bench Members will then take the oath or affirm, including the occupants of the Privy Council Benches by the Bar.</p>
    <p pid="a1.4/2">The House has decided that priority at this point should also be given to any Member with a disability or impaired mobility who is able to take the oath or affirm. Other Members will then take the oath or affirm. Members should come to the Table from the Bar end of the Chamber, bringing their Writ of Summons. The annunciators will indicate from time to time the number of Members waiting in the Chamber to take the oath or affirm. When all Members present have taken the oath or affirmed, the House will adjourn during pleasure, resuming at intervals until 7.30 pm tonight. The time of resumption will be shown in each case on the annunciators.</p>
    <p pid="a1.4/3">At some point during today’s sitting, I expect that the Royal Commission will resume to confirm Her Majesty’s Royal Approbation for the Commons’ choice of Speaker. That may happen as early as 3.45 pm, but it is of course dependent on proceedings in the Commons.</p>
    <p pid="a1.4/4" class="italic">The Lord Speaker, singly in the first place, took the oath.</p>
    <p pid="a1.4/5" class="italic">Several noble Lords took the oath or made the solemn affirmation, and signed an undertaking to abide by the Code of Conduct.</p>

    <p pid="a3.1/1">My Lords, I beg to acquaint the House that a Commission has been issued under Her Majesty’s Great Seal to several Lords therein named authorising the said Lords to declare in the name and on behalf of Her Majesty Her Majesty’s approbation of the choice of the Commons of Sir Lindsay Hoyle to be their Speaker.</p>
    <p pid="a3.1/2" class="italic">Then, the Lords Commissioners (the Lord Privy Seal (Baroness Evans of Bowes Park), the Lord Speaker (Lord Fowler), Baroness Smith of Basildon, Lord Newby and Lord Judge) being robed and seated in front of the Throne, the Lord Privy Seal directed Black Rod as follows:</p>
    <p pid="a3.1/3">Let the Commons know that the Lords Commissioners desire their immediate attendance in this House.</p>
    <p pid="a3.1/4" class="italic">Then, the Commons being at the Bar, Mr Speaker-Elect (Sir Lindsay Hoyle), addressing the Royal Commissioners, said:</p>
    <p pid="a3.1/5">My Lords, I have to acquaint your Lordships that Her Majesty’s faithful Commons, in obedience to the Royal Command, have, in the exercise of their undoubted rights and privileges, proceeded to the election of a Speaker, and that their choice has fallen on me. I therefore present myself at your Lordships’ Bar and submit myself with all humility for Her Majesty’s gracious Approbation.</p>

    <p pid="a4.0/1">Sir Lindsay, we are commanded to assure you that Her Majesty is so fully sensible of your zeal in the public service, and of your ample sufficiency to execute the arduous duties which her faithful Commons have selected you to discharge, that Her Majesty does most readily approve and confirm you as their Speaker.</p>
    <p pid="a4.0/2" class="italic">The Speaker of the House of Commons said:</p>
    <p pid="a4.0/3">My Lords, I submit myself with all humility and gratitude to Her Majesty’s Royal Will and Pleasure. I pray that if, in the discharge of my duties and in the maintenance of the rights and privileges of the Commons’ House of Parliament, I should inadvertently fall into any error, it may be imputed to me alone, not to Her Majesty’s faithful Commons.</p>

    <p pid="a4.1/1">Mr Speaker, we have it further in Command to inform you that Her Majesty does most readily confirm all the rights and privileges which have ever been granted to or conferred upon the Commons by Her Majesty or any of her Royal predecessors. With respect to yourself, Sir, though Her Majesty is sensible that you stand in no need of such assurance, Her Majesty will ever place the most favourable construction upon your words and actions.</p>
